{"title": "Can stellar wobble in triple systems mimic a planet?", "abstract": "The first extrasolar planets have been detected by the measurement of the wobble of the parent star. This wobble leads to the periodic modulation of three observables: the radial velocity, the position on the sky and the time of arrival of periodic signals. We show that the same wobble, and therefore the same modulation of the three observables, can be due to the presence of a more distant binary stellar companion. Thus, the observation of the wobble does not, by itself, constitute a proof of a planet detection. In particular, astrometric confirmation of a wobble does not necessarily provide a sufficient proof of the existence of a planet candidate detected by radial velocity. Additional conditions, which we discuss here, must be fulfilled. We investigate the observed wobble for the planet candidates already detected and we find that, for each case, a wobble due to a binary stellar companion can be excluded. But for apparent Saturn-like planets in wide orbits, there may be an ambiguity in future detections, especially in spaceborne astrometric missions. We conclude that, in some cases, a definitive proof for the presence of a planet requires further observations such as direct imaging.", "DOI": "10.1051/0004-6361:20053447", "source": "arxiv", "time": [2009, 11, 11], "answer": "maybe"}

{"title": "Do black holes radiate?", "abstract": "The prediction that black holes radiate due to quantum effects is often considered one of the most secure in quantum field theory in curved space-time. Yet this prediction rests on two dubious assumptions: that ordinary physics may be applied to vacuum fluctuations at energy scales increasing exponentially without bound; and that quantum-gravitational effects may be neglected. Various suggestions have been put forward to address these issues: that they might be explained away by lessons from sonic black hole models; that the prediction is indeed successfully reproduced by quantum gravity; that the success of the link provided by the prediction between black holes and thermodynamics justifies the prediction. This paper explains the nature of the difficulties, and reviews the proposals that have been put forward to deal with them. None of the proposals put forward can so far be considered to be really successful, and simple dimensional arguments show that quantum-gravitational effects might well alter the evaporation process outlined by Hawking. Thus a definitive theoretical treatment will require an understanding of quantum gravity in at least some regimes. Until then, no compelling theoretical case for or against radiation by black holes is likely to be made. The possibility that non-radiating \"mini\" black holes exist should be taken seriously; such holes could be part of the dark matter in the Universe. Attempts to place observational limits on the number of \"mini\" black holes would be most welcome.", "DOI": "10.1088/0034-4885/66/6/202", "source": "arxiv", "time": [2009, 11, 10], "answer": "maybe"}

In this work, we examine the Higgs decay to neutralino dark matter in low energy SUSY by considering three different models: the minimal supersymmetric standard model (MSSM), the next-to-minimal supersymmetric standard models (NMSSM) and the nearly minimal supersymmetric standard model (nMSSM). Under current experimental constraints at 2-sigma level , we scan over the parameter space of each model. Then in the allowed parameter space we calculate the branching ratio of the SM-like Higgs decay to neutralino dark matter and examine its observability at the LHC by considering three production channels: the weak boson fusion VV->h, the associated production with a Z-boson pp->hZ+X or a pair of top quarks pp->htt_bar+X. We find that in the MSSM such a decay is far below the detectable level; while in both the NMSSM and nMSSM the decay branching ratio can be large enough to be observable at the LHC.", "DOI": "10.1007/JHEP06(2012)145", "source": "arxiv", "time": [2015, 6, 4], "label": "Yes.", "answer": "maybe"}

Abundances in the catalog were derived from averaged spectra, obtained by stacking individual spectra according to central velocity dispersion, as a proxy of galaxy mass. We tested initial mass functions already used in a previous work, as well as two new models, based on low-mass tapered (\"bimodal\") IMFs, where the IMF becomes either (1) bottom-heavy in more massive galaxies, or (2) is time-dependent, switching from top-heavy to bottom-heavy in the course of galactic evolution. We found that observations could only be reproduced by models assuming either a constant, Salpeter IMF, or a time-dependent distribution, as other IMFs failed. We further tested the models by calculating their M/L ratios. We conclude that a constant, time-independent bottom-heavy IMF does not reproduce the data, especially the increase of the $[\\alpha/Fe]$ ratio with galactic stellar mass, whereas a variable IMF, switching from top to bottom-heavy, can match observations.

{"title": "Multi-dimensional liquid chromatography and metabolomics, are two dimensions better than one?", "abstract": "While data processing methods in metabolomic studies often work with 'n' number of dimensions, analytical techniques, with the notable exception of NMR, have mostly stuck only to one. Peak overlap continues to be a problem and there is an ever-present demand to maximize the number of metabolites that can be separated and identified in a single run. One method that might help to overcome these issues is multidimensional liquid chromatography, which uses two columns of different phases. A sequential collection of aliquots is made from the first column and reinjected onto a second, and the resulting data are then plotted in 2D or 3D space. The total peak capacity of such a system is the combined peak capacities of each column. The 'offline' version of this technique, using a fraction collector, was introduced over 30 years ago but with recent advances in instrumentation and software, particularly the 'online' approach using automated switching valves, has led to increasing interest in the technique. Both offline and online methods can be carried out as a comprehensive procedure, or via 'heart-cutting', in which only specific peaks are analysed in the second dimension. Past applications include proteomics, natural product chemistry, forensic science and pharmaceutical analysis. These successes are likely to be built on in the future as new column chemistries and bio-informatic approaches are developed. In this review an overview of the theory of twodimensional liquid chromatography is presented, its potential in the field of metabolomics is assessed and predictions for future research directions are made.", "DOI": "10.2174/2213235x03666150403231202", "len_ids": "039-049-157-438-952", "time": [2018, 5, 12], "source": "question/lens", "answer": "maybe"}

The results indicate that chain length and penultimate unit effects are extremely important during the early stages of the polymerisation process. In the case of the attacking radical (i.e., R\u2022 in: R\u2022+S=C(Z)SR'\u2192 RSC\u2022(Z)SR'), the equilibrium constant varies by over three orders of magnitude on extending R\u2022 from the styryl unimer to the trimer species and actually increases with chain length, further confirming that K is high in this system. When the reactions of the cumyl leaving group and cyanoisopropyl initiating species, which are also present in CDB-mediated polymerisation of styrene in the presence of the initiator 2,2'-azoisobutyronitrile, are also included, the variation in K extends over five orders of magnitude. Although less significant, the influence of the R' group should also be taken into account in a complete kinetic model of the RAFT process. However, for most practical purposes, its chain length effects beyond the unimer stage may be ignored. These results indicate that current simplified models of the RAFT process, which typically ignore all chain length effects in the R and R' positions, and all substituent effects in the R' position, may be inadequate, particularly in modelling the initial stages of the process.", "DOI": "10.1002/mats.200600021", "len_ids": "004-670-670-520-282", "time": [2018, 5, 12], "source": "question/lens", "label": "yes", "answer": "maybe"}
{"title": "Are fish in danger? A review of environmental effects of marine renewable energy on fishes", "abstract": "Many fish species are threatened worldwide by overfishing, contamination, coastal development, climate change, and other anthropogenic activities. Marine renewable energy (MRE) is under development as a sustainable alternative to carbon-based energy sources. Regulators and stakeholders worry that MRE devices will add another threat to fish populations already under pressure. This paper reviews the current knowledge of potential effects of MRE development on fish. These may include collision with devices that may lead to injury or death; underwater noise generated by MRE devices that may affect fish behavior and health; electromagnetic fields from power cables and other electrical infrastructure that may lead sensitive fish species to approach or avoid them; changes in critical fish habitat, including nursery, feeding, and spawning grounds; shoaling of fish around MRE devices; and displacement of fish populations or communities around arrays of multiple MRE devices. Field- and laboratory-based studies that have examined fish presence, avoidance, and evasion around MRE devices suggest that collisions are rare. Progress is being made on data collection and modeling tools to estimate fish encounter rates with MRE devices, the consequences of collisions, and population-level ecological risks. Similarly, studies exposing fish to turbine-generated noise and electromagnetic fields demonstrate little effect on fish behavior; in fact, MRE device noise falls below reported hearing thresholds. Inquiries into the effects of MRE devices on fish are ongoing, and research is needed to ensure the health of fish populations while facilitating the sustainable development of renewable energy sources.", "time": [2021, 8, 24], "DOI": "10.1016/j.biocon.2021.109297", "source": "6cross_chem", "answer": "maybe"}

Studies have shown an increase in postoperative quadriceps weakness (QW) and pain associated with tourniquet use during TKA.

The latter also hinders unidirectional propagation of logic signal from the input of a logic gate to the output. Other versions of these transistors appear to have better gain and isolation, but not better than those of a conventional transistor.

Combination of dynamical and thermal constraints puts very stringent lower limits on the surface density and temperature of disks capable of fragmenting into self-gravitating objects: for the gravitational instability to form giant planets at 10 AU gas temperature at this location must exceed 10^3 K for a minimum disk mass of 0.7 M_Sun and minimum disk luminosity of 40 L_Sun. Although these requirements relax in more distant parts of the disk, masses of bound objects formed as a result of instability even at 100 AU are too large (\\sim 10 M_Jupiter) to explain characteristics of known extrasolar giant planets.

Diphenylsilane (SiH) has been used in combination with different multifunctional acrylates (AC) and conversions of 100% and about 25% for AC and SiH, respectively, have been reached. Final tack free polymers are obtained as a consequence of the fact that the polymerization rates are not affected by oxygen.

{"title": "Do Urbanization and Energy Consumption Change the Role in Environmental Degradation in the European Union Countries?", "abstract": "Nowadays, increased urbanization is visible in most European Union countries. At the same time, it can be noticed that in the studied period (2000\u20132018), GDP per capita increased, and CO2 emissions per capita and energy consumption per capita decreased. These trends should be assessed in an unequivocally positive way. Considering these trends, especially with regard to economic development, our research goal is to answer the following questions: is there a long-run relationship between urbanization, energy consumption, economic growth, and carbon dioxide emissions, and what roles do urbanization and energy consumption play in the concept of the environmental Kuznets curve? This study aims to contribute to this growing area of research by exploring the European Union countries in the period covering the accession of new member states from Central Europe that needs intensifying European environmental policy. In order to test cointegration, we used Pedroni and Westerlund\u2019s panel tests. To estimate the long-run coefficients, we employed the FMOLS, MG, CCEMG, and AMG tests. Our findings confirmed the long-run relationship between variables. We find that urbanization has a high negative impact on carbon dioxide emissions per capita.

A model-oriented meta-analysis", "abstract": "The temperature dependence of the reaction kinetics of the Rubisco enzyme implies that, at the level of a chloroplast, the response of photosynthesis to rising atmospheric CO2 concentration (Ca) will increase with increasing air temperature. Vegetation models incorporating this interaction predict that the response of net primary productivity (NPP) to elevated CO2 (eCa) will increase with rising temperature and will be substantially larger in warm tropical forests than in cold boreal forests. We tested these model predictions against evidence from eCa experiments by carrying out two meta-analyses. Firstly, we tested for an interaction effect on growth responses in factorial eCa \u00d7 temperature experiments. This analysis showed a positive, but nonsignificant interaction effect between eCa and temperature. Secondly, we tested field-based eCa experiments on woody plants across the globe for a relationship between the eCa effect on plant biomass and mean annual temperature (MAT). This second analysis showed a positive but nonsignificant correlation between the eCa response and MAT. The magnitude of the interactions between CO2 and temperature found in both meta-analyses were consistent with model predictions, even though both analyses gave nonsignificant results. Thus, we conclude that it is not possible to distinguish between the competing hypotheses of no interaction vs. an interaction based on Rubisco kinetics from the available experimental database.

Until such experimental data are available, model predictions should aim to incorporate uncertainty about this interaction.", "DOI": "10.1111/gcb.12962", "len_ids": "023-518-955-402-004", "time": [2018, 5, 12], "source": "question/lens", "answer": "no"}
{"title": "Dispersibility of carbon nanotubes in organic solvents: do we really have predictive models?", "abstract": "Predicting the physico-chemical properties of carbon nanotubes (CNTs) is highly demanding owing to tedious experimental efforts involved in their determination. Dispersibility of CNTs in organic solvents is one such property; however, studies involving its quantitative prediction are quite scarce and highly questionable, particularly, when the real external predictivity is desired. This work examines the real external predictivity of the existing models as well as those developed in the present work (using quantum-chemical descriptors) for the dispersibility of single-walled CNTs (SWCNTs). The real external predictivity is assessed on the basis of state-of-the-art external validation parameters obtained by employing an external prediction set which is not exposed to the model used for the prediction. Notably, most of the present and existing models pass through the internal validation, but unfortunately, barring some exception of poly-parameter models, most of the models fail when it comes to the external validation. Their failure was attributed to the descriptors employed which are in fact based on the gas-phase single molecular structure of organic solvents as well as based on the implicit solvent methods. A future approach towards the predictive models for the dispersibility of CNTs is suggested based on the explicit solvent methods.", "DOI": "10.1007/s11051-017-3883-x", "len_ids": "078-350-659-453-228", "time": [2018, 5, 12], "source": "question/lens", "label": "yes", "answer": "maybe"}
{"title": "Bubble Curtains: Herbivore Exclusion Devices for Ecology and Restoration of Marine Ecosystems?", "abstract": "Herbivorous fishes play a critical role in maintaining or disrupting the ecological resilience of many kelp forests, coral reefs and seagrass ecosystems, worldwide. The increasing rate and scale of benthic habitat loss under global change has magnified the importance of herbivores and highlights the need to study marine herbivory at ecologically relevant scales. Currently, underwater herbivore exclusions (or inclusions) have been restricted to small scale experimental plots, in large part due to the challenges of designing structures that can withstand the physical forces of waves and currents, without drastically altering the physical environment inside the exclusion area. We tested the ability of bubble curtains to deter herbivorous fishes from feeding on seaweeds as an alternative to the use of rigid exclusion cages. Kelps (Ecklonia radiata) were transplanted onto reefs with high browsing herbivore pressure into either unprotected plots, exclusion cages or plots protected by bubble curtains of 0.785 m2 and 3.14 m2. Remote underwater video was used to compare the behavioural response of fishes to kelps protected and unprotected by bubble curtains. Kelp biomass loss was significantly lower inside the bubble curtains compared to unprotected kelps and did not differ from kelp loss rates in traditional exclusion cages. Consistent with this finding, no herbivorous fishes were observed entering into the bubble curtain at any point during the experiment. In contrast, fish bite rates on unprotected kelps were 1621 \u00b1 702 bites hr-1 (mean \u00b1 SE). Our study provides initial evidence that bubble curtains can exclude herbivorous fishes, paving the way for future studies to examine their application at larger spatial and temporal scales, beyond what has been previously feasible using traditional exclusion cages.", "DOI": "10.3389/fmars.2017.00302", "len_ids": "101-809-312-011-832", "time": [2018, 5, 13], "source": "question/lens", "label": "Yes.", "answer": "maybe"}

While Electron Localization Function (ELF) topological analysis of the reagents indicates that coordination of Cr(CO)3 to the aromatic ring of styrene does not cause any remarkable change in its electronic structure, it increases its global electrophilicity but does not efficiently activate the C\u2212C double bond. Thus, the DA reaction of styrene with Cp, which has a high activation energy, 15.9 kcal \u22c5 mol\u22121, is decreased by only 2.1 kcal \u22c5 mol\u22121 with the formation of the corresponding Cr(CO)3 complex. This DA reaction is endo and anti stereoselective. Analysis of the geometrical parameters and the electron density distribution at the endo TSs confirms that coordination of the Cr(CO)3 complex to the aromatic ring of styrene does not produce any appreciable change at the corresponding TSs. These DA reactions, which have low polar character, take place through a one-step mechanism via an asynchronous endo TS, in which the formation of the C4\u2212C5 simple bond is more advanced than the C1\u2212C6 one.

The location of maximum ionic wind is found to be directly linked with the maximum elongation of the streamers at several millimeters from the exposed electrode. In both positive and negative phases of the AC-DBD operation, residual volumetric and surface charges once again linked to the streamer formation and afterburn, result to a variety of positive EHD force zones which, when time-averaged in one AC period, contribute to the generation of the experimentally observed induced thin wall jet.

Prospectively collected data of 85 heart transplant-eligible Jarvik 2000 recipients who met the study criteria were retrospectively analyzed for the incidence, correlating factors, and clinical outcomes of de novo AI. All data were provided by the Japanese Registry for Mechanically Assisted Circulatory Support. De novo AI occurred in 58 patients, 23 of whom developed at least moderate AI during a median support duration of 23.5 months. Freedom from moderate or greater AI was 84.4%, 66.1% and 60.2% at 1, 2 and 3 years, respectively. Multivariate analyses revealed that progressive AI was correlated with decreased pulse pressure after implantation . No correlation was found for mortality or other adverse events, including stroke, bleeding, infection, pump failure, hemolysis, and readmission. The benefit of the Jarvik 2000\u2032s current ILS mode against AI appears to be minimal. However, in this limited cohort where all recipients underwent implantation as a bridge to transplantation, the impact of de novo progressive AI on other clinical adversities was also minimal.", "DOI": "10.1007/s10047-020-01234-4", "len_ids": "072-614-074-320-76X", "time": [2021, 1, 12], "source": "question/lens", "label": "Yes.", "answer": "maybe"}

We need a non-invasive technological approach that would significantly improve its diagnosis. Surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) is a growing technique that can provide a molecular diagnostic fingerprint in just a few minutes, without the need for prior sample preparation. The aim of this pilot in vivo study was to prove that multivariate analysis of SER spectra collected on plasma samples could be employed for non-invasive diagnosis of UC. Plasma samples were collected from healthy subjects (n\u2009=\u200935) and patients with UC (n\u2009=\u200928). SERS spectra were acquired using a 785-nm excitation laser line and a solid plasmonic substrate developed in our laboratory using an original procedure described in the literature. The classification accuracy yielded by SERS was assessed by principal component analysis-linear discriminant analysis (PCA-LDA) and partial least squares discriminant analysis (PLS-DA). PCA-LDA differentiated UC samples from those of healthy subjects with a sensitivity of 86%, a specificity of 92%, and an accuracy of 89%, the AUC being 0.96. The PLS-DA analysis resulted in a sensitivity of 89%, a specificity of 94%, an accuracy of 92%, and an AUC value of 0.92. Several spectral bands were associated with UC: 376-420, 440-513, 686-715, 919-939, 1035-1062, 1083-1093, 1120-1132, 1148-1156, 1191-1211, 1234-1262, 1275-1294, 1382-1405, 1511-1526, and 1693-1702 cm-1.

One possible explanation for this disparity is that synonymous substitutions in plant mitochondrial genes are not truly neutral and selection keeps their occurrence low. If this were true, the explanation for the disparity in mutation rates in genes and non-genes needs to consider selection as well as mechanisms of DNA repair. Rps14 is co-transcribed with cob and rpl5 in most plant mitochondrial genomes, but in some genomes, rps14 has been duplicated to the nucleus leaving a pseudogene in the mitochondria. This provides an opportunity to compare neutral substitution rates in pseudogenes with synonymous substitution rates in the orthologs. Genes and pseudogenes of rps14 have been aligned among different species and the mutation rates have been calculated. Neutral substitution rates in pseudogenes and synonymous substitution rates in genes are significantly different, providing evidence that synonymous substitutions in plant mitochondrial genes are not completely neutral. The non-neutrality is not sufficient to completely explain the exceptionally low mutation rates in land plant mitochondrial genomes, but selective forces appear to play a small role.", "label": "Yes.", "source": "6cross_chem", "answer": "no"}

This study evaluated the immunogenicity and toxicity of eggshell membranes (ESM) when administered as an adjuvant for the recombinant HBV vaccine (rHBsAg) in albino mice. Differential white blood cell analysis, as well as the titer measurement of Immunoglobulin G, subclass G1 and G2a on indirect ELISA, was performed to measure the immune-modulatory potentials of ESM. Moreover, analysis of the liver marker enzyme (AST and ALT) and body/liver weights was performed to ascertain the toxicity level of ESM. Finally, Immuno-informatic analysis was used to investigate the immune-modulatory potential of individual member proteins of ESM. Our results showed a significant improvement in the experimental group's lymphocyte count after boost-dose administration compared to the controls, whereas there was no significant change in the granulocyte population. Furthermore, the formulations (ESM-rHBsAg) significantly improved IgG and IgG1 titers after each successive immunization. Body/liver weight and liver function showed ESM non-toxic to mice. The immunoinformatic analysis discovered ovalbumin, lysozyme-C, and UFM-1 as the member proteins of ESM with immune-modulatory activities of activating antigen-presenting cells (APC). This study has provided a clue into the potential valorization of eggshell membranes and their peptides as an adjuvant for vaccines such as HBV.

Current knowledge about the uptake transporters expressed at the BBB and brain parenchymal cells has been used for delivery of CNS drugs to the brain via targeting transporters. Although many transporter-utilizing (pro)drugs and nanocarriers have been developed to improve the uptake of drugs to the brain, their success rate of translation from preclinical development to humans is negligible. In the present review, we provide a systematic summary of the current progress in development of transporter-utilizing (pro)drugs and nanocarriers for delivery of drugs to the brain.

Here we detail the venom composition of male Physocyclus mexicanus using proteomic analyses and venom-gland transcriptomes (\"venomics\"). We also analyze the venom's potency on insects, and assemble available evidence regarding mammalian toxicity. The majority of the venom consists of proteins homologous to known venom toxins including enzymes and venom peptide neurotoxins. We identify 17 new groups of peptides (U1-17-PHTX) most of which are homologs of known venom peptides and are predicted to have an inhibitor cysteine knot fold; of these, 13 are confirmed in the proteome. Neprilysins (M13 peptidases), and astacins (M12 peptidases) are the most abundant venom proteins, respectively representing 15 and 11% of the individual proteins and 32 and 20% of the tryptic peptides detected in crude venom. Comparative evidence suggests that the neprilysin gene family is expressed in venoms across a range of spider taxa, but has undergone an expansion in the venoms of pholcids and may play a central functional role in these spiders. Bioassays of crude venoms on crickets resulted in an effective paralytic dose of 3.9 \u00b5g/g, which is comparable to that of crude venoms of Plectreurys tristis and other Synspermiata taxa. However, crickets exhibit flaccid paralysis and regions of darkening that are not observed after P. tristis envenomation. Documented bites on humans make clear that while these spiders can bite, the typical result is a mild sting with no long-lasting effects.

The non-detection of single point sources or -- almost equivalently -- the absence, in the IceCube events, of multiplets originating from the same sky position, constrains the cosmic density and the neutrino output of these sources, pointing to a numerous population of faint sources.

Modeling the spectral energy distribution of a FR0 radiogalaxy recently associated to a $\\gamma$-ray source detected by the Large Area Telescope onboard Fermi, we derive the physical parameters of its jet, in particular the power carried by it. We consider the possible mechanisms of neutrino production, concluding that $p\\gamma$ reactions in the jet between protons and ambient radiation is too inefficient to sustain the required output.

An Observational, Theoretical, and Experimental Study", "abstract": "With a total mass similar to the main asteroid belt, the Jovian Trojan asteroids are a major feature in the solar system. Based upon the thermal infrared spectra of the largest Trojans obtained with the Spitzer space telescope, Emery et al. (2006) suggested that the surfaces of these Trojans may consist of fine-grained silicates suspended in a transparent matrix. To explore the transparent matrix hypothesis, we adopted a modified radiative transfer model to fit the Trojan spectra simultaneously both in the near and the thermal infrared regions. Our model shows that the Trojan spectra over a wide wavelength range can be consistently explained by fine grained silicates (1-5 wt.%) and highly absorbing material suspended in a transparent matrix. The matrix is consistent with a deposit of salt on the surfaces of the large Trojans. However, this consistency is not an actual detection of salt and other alternatives may still be possible. We suggest that early in the Solar System history, short-lived radionuclides heated ice-rich Trojans and caused melting, internal circulation of water and dissolution of soluble materials. Briny water volcanism were facilitated by internal volatiles and a possibly global sill of frozen brine was formed beneath the cold primitive crust. The frozen brine layer was likely to be evacuated by impact erosions and evaporation of the exposed brines eventually left a lag deposit of salt.

The kidney function test after 24 hours of contrast admission showed a creatinine level of 2.37 \u00b1 1.20 mg/dL (P&lt;0.05) and the eGFR of 34.74 \u00b1 16.10 mL/min. There was no significant difference in creatinine levels between stage 3A and stage 5 CKD. There was a significant reduction in creatinine in stage 3B CKD, from 1.917 \u00b1 0.22 to 1.71 \u00b1 0.37 mg/dL (P = 0.001); and stage 4 CKD, from 2.77 \u00b1 0.55 to 2.72 \u00b1 0.94 mg/dL (P = 0.013). CKD is a risk factor for developing CI-AKI after PCI, which is a marker of poor long-term outcomes. The development of CI-AKI is a strong predictor of post-PCI bleeding, which aggravates hemodynamic instability. The combination of NAC and NaHCO3 exerts a better antioxidative effect, which reduces the harmful short-term and long-term consequences of contrast media. Previous studies revealed the use of low-to-zero contrast media was safer in CKD patients who had undergone PCI. By applying these measures, our study showed a good outcome of PCI with no worsening renal function in CKD patients. With good prophylaxis measures, such as using minimal volume contrast media, adequate rehydration, and the combination of sodium bicarbonate and acetylcysteine, it is safe to do PCI in moderate to severe CKD patients.

{"title": "Mitochondrial Hormesis in Pancreatic \u03b2 Cells: Does Uncoupling Protein 2 Play a Role?", "abstract": "In pancreatic \u03b2 cells, mitochondrial metabolism translates glucose sensing into signals regulating insulin secretion. Chronic exposure of \u03b2 cells to excessive nutrients, namely, glucolipotoxicity, impairs \u03b2-cell function. This is associated with elevated ROS production from overstimulated mitochondria. Mitochondria are not only the major source of cellular ROS, they are also the primary target of ROS attacks. The mitochondrial uncoupling protein UCP2, even though its uncoupling properties are debated, has been associated with protective functions against ROS toxicity. Hormesis, an adaptive response to cellular stresses, might contribute to the protection against \u03b2-cell death, possibly limiting the development of type 2 diabetes. Mitochondrial hormesis, or mitohormesis, is a defense mechanism observed in ROS-induced stress-responses by mitochondria. In \u03b2 cells, mitochondrial damages induced by sublethal exogenous H2O2 can induce secondary repair and defense mechanisms. In this context, UCP2 is a marker of mitohormesis, being upregulated following stress conditions. When overexpressed in nonstressed naive cells, UCP2 confers resistance to oxidative stress. Whether treatment with mitohormetic inducers is sufficient to restore or ameliorate secretory function of \u03b2 cells remains to be determined.", "DOI": "10.1155/2012/740849", "len_ids": "077-879-721-495-458", "time": [2018, 5, 11], "source": "7question/lens", "label": "Yes.", "answer": "yes"}

We studied a range of hydration levels (\u03bb) at temperatures of 300 and 360 K, and compare the results to our findings in the benchmark Nafion\u00ae membrane. The water cluster diameter is nearly the same in the two membranes, while the extent of SO3\u2212 clustering is more in the SSC membrane. The calculated cluster diameter of about 2.4 nm is in excellent agreement with the recently proposed cylindrical water channel model of these membranes. The diffusion coefficients of H2O and H3O+ are similar in SSC and Nafion membranes. Raising the temperature of the SSC membrane from 300 to 360 K provides a much bigger increase in proton vehicular diffusion coefficient than changing the side chain length. H3O+ ions are found to exchange more frequently with SO3\u2212 partners at the higher temperature. Our key findings are that (a) the hydrophobic\u2013hydrophilic separation in the two membranes is surprisingly similar; (b) at all hydration levels studied, the long side chain of Nafion is bent and is effectively equivalent to a short side chain in terms of extension into the water domain; (c) vehicular proton transport occurs mainly between SO3\u2212 groups; and (d) changing the size of the simulation cell does not change the results significantly.

{"title": "Quasi-realistic heterotic-string models with vanishing one-loop cosmological constant and perturbatively broken supersymmetry?", "abstract": "Quasi-realistic string models in the free fermionic formulation typically contain an anomalous U(1), which gives rise to a Fayet-Iliopoulos D-term that breaks supersymmetry at the one--loop level in string perturbation theory. Supersymmetry is traditionally restored by imposing F- and D-flatness on the vacuum. By employing the standard analysis of flat directions we present a quasi--realistic three generation string model in which stringent F- and D-flat solution do not appear to exist to all orders in the superpotential. We speculate that this result is indicative of the non-existence of supersymmetric flat F- and D-solutions in this model. We provide some arguments in support of this scenario and discuss its potential implications. Bose-Fermi degeneracy of the string spectrum implies that the one--loop partition function and hence the one-loop cosmological constant vanishes in the model. If our assertion is correct, this model may represent the first known example with vanishing cosmological constant and perturbatively broken supersymmetry. We discuss the distinctive properties of the internal free fermion boundary conditions that may correspond to a large set of models that share these properties. The geometrical moduli in this class of models are fixed due to asymmetric boundary conditions, whereas absence of supersymmetric flat directions would imply that the supersymmetric moduli are fixed as well and the dilaton may be fixed by hidden sector nonperturbative effects.", "DOI": "10.1103/PhysRevD.78.046009", "source": "arxiv", "time": [2008, 11, 26], "label": "Yes.", "answer": "yes"}

Changes in the metabolism of these amino acids influence serum lipoprotein concentrations, although the underlying mechanisms are still poorly understood. However, recent evidence has suggested that the enzyme stearoyl-CoA desaturase-1 (SCD-1) may be the link between these two metabolic pathways. SCD-1 is a key enzyme for the synthesis of monounsaturated fatty acids. Its main substrates C16:0 and C18:0 and products palmitoleic acid (C16:1) and oleic acid (C18:1) are the most abundant fatty acids in triglycerides, cholesterol esters and membrane phospholipids. A significant suppression of SCD-1 has been observed in several animal models with disrupted sulfur amino acid metabolism, and the activity of SCD-1 is also associated with the levels of these amino acids in humans. This enzyme also appears to be involved in the etiology of metabolic syndromes because its suppression results in decreased fat deposits (regardless of food intake), improved insulin sensitivity and higher basal energy expenditure. Interestingly, this anti-obesogenic phenotype has also been described in humans and animals with sulfur amino acid disorders, which is consistent with the hypothesis that SCD-1 activity is influenced by these amino acids, in particularly cysteine, which is a strong and independent predictor of SCD-1 activity and fat storage.

{"title": "Can surface energy be a parameter to define morphological change of rock-salt crystals with additives?

On the basis of first principles DFT calculations of the surface energies before and after the adsorption of surface-capping agent (additive) on the NaCl surfaces, we have shown that the surface energy differences among the three important faces (100), (110) and (111) corroborates the change in character of salt crystals observed experimentally. In accordance with the surface energy calculations, the stability order of the three crystallographic surfaces of NaCl was found to be (100) > (110) > (111) in the absence of additive molecules (i.e. clean surfaces). This result is in concurrence with the fact that salt crystals are cubes with (100) surface when grown in aqueous solution. The applied computational methodology towards the determination of surface energies was found to be trustworthy as it has reproduced well the experimental surface energy values of 189 erg cm\u22122 and 445 erg cm\u22122 for (100) and (110) NaCl surfaces, respectively. However, the trend in the decreased surface energy values has been found to be reversed for (100) < (110) < (111) when these surfaces were capped with known additive molecules. This work demonstrates that the change in the thermodynamic quantity (i.e. surface energy) in presence of additives can be an observable quantity, which can interface with the change in the shape of the crystals.

For many amphibian and aquatic insect species, exposure to contaminants is probably greatest during their fully aquatic embryonic and larval stages because these stages cannot readily escape water bodies where many contaminants accumulate and concentrate. Hence, by accelerating embryonic and larval development, global warming might reduce the duration of contaminant exposure for these taxa. To test this hypothesis, we isolated the effects of a temperature gradient (13-25\u00b0C) on susceptibility and exposure of the streamside salamander, Ambystoma barbouri, to the herbicide atrazine by quantifying growth, survival, hatching, and metamorphosis under an atrazine exposure duration that was either constant or that depended on time to metamorphosis (and thus temperature). Increasing atrazine concentrations reduced growth, delayed hatching and metamorphosis, and decreased embryonic and larval survival. Increasing temperatures enhanced growth, accelerated development, and reduced survival for embryos but not larvae. With the exception of growth, increasing temperatures generally did not enhance the toxicity of atrazine, but they did generally ameliorate the adverse effects of atrazine by accelerating development and reducing the duration of atrazine exposure. The actual effects of climate change on contaminants remains difficult to predict because temperature changes can affect chemical use, uptake, excretion, biotransformation, fate, transport, and bioavailability. However, this work highlights the importance of explicitly considering how climate change will affect both exposure and toxicity to contaminants to accurately assess risk.", "DOI": "10.1111/j.1365-2486.2010.02301.x", "len_ids": "022-216-748-412-170", "time": [2018, 5, 11], "source": "question/lens", "label": "Yes.", "answer": "yes"}

{"title": "Highly sensitive amperometric detection of drugs and antioxidants on non-functionalized multi-walled carbon nanotubes: Effect of metallic impurities?", "abstract": "This work demonstrates that the electrochemistry of different molecules of pharmaceutical interest, including omeprazole, ciprofloxacin, dopamine, catechol, hydroquinone, and the antioxidants tert-butylhydroquine, gallic acid, propyl gallate, and pyrogallol, is affected by the functionalization of multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs). Voltammetric and amperometric measurements confirmed the improved analytical characteristics of the GCE modified with non-functionalized (NF) MWCNTs (as-received) in comparison with functionalized MWCNTs (F-MWCNTs). Increase in voltammetric responses (up to 10-fold), higher slope values for the amperometric detection of the analytes (up to 7-fold) and, for some molecules, widening of the linear working range, were verified. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy measurements also revealed higher electrochemical activity of non-functionalized MWCNTs. The presence of metallic impurities on NF-MWCNTs, removed by functionalization with HNO3/H2SO4, may contribute the improved performance of NF-MWCNT-modified electrodes; however, decrease in electroactive area of F-MWCNTs has to be considered. Although acid functionalization introduced oxygenated groups on the MWCNT structure, the presence of metallic impurities (Fe and Co) and higher electroactive area of NF-MWCNTs play major role on the increase in sensitivity of the electrochemical sensors. As a conclusion, we propose the use of pristine MWCNTs to produce more sensitive amperometric sensors.", "time": [2017, 4, 14], "DOI": "10.1016/j.electacta.2017.04.050", "source": "3cross_byjournal/elsevier", "label": "Yes.", "answer": "yes"}

For this purpose, one option is to perform a registration of preoperative 3D data and 3D surface patches reconstructed from laparoscopic images. Part of an automatic 3D registration pipeline is the feature description, which takes into account various geometric and spatial information. Since there is no leading feature descriptor in the field of LLS, two feature descriptors are compared in this paper: The Fast Point Feature Histogram (FPFH) and Triple Orthogonal Local Depth Images (TOLDI). To evaluate their performance, three perturbations were induced: varying surface patch sizes, spatial displacement, and Gaussian deformation. Registration was performed using the RANSAC algorithm. FPFH outperformed TOLDI for small surface patches and in case of Gaussian deformations in terms of registration accuracy. In contrast, TOLDI showed lower registration errors for patches with spatial displacement. While developing a 3D-3D registration pipeline, the choice of the feature descriptor is of importance, consequently a careful choice suitable for the application in LLS is necessary.", "DOI": "10.1515/cdbme-2022-0012", "len_ids": "028-654-201-666-992", "time": [2022, 7, 31], "source": "question/lens", "label": "Yes.", "answer": "yes"}

The origin and structure of this faulty cubic ice, presumed to form in the atmosphere, has long been a puzzle. Here we use large-scale molecular dynamics simulations with the mW water model to investigate the crystallization of water at 180 K and elucidate the development of cubic and hexagonal features in ice as it nucleates, grows and consolidates into crystallites with characteristic dimensions of a few nanometres. The simulations indicate that the ice crystallized at 180 K contains layers of cubic ice and hexagonal ice in a ratio of approximately 2 to 1. The stacks of hexagonal ice are very short, mostly one and two layers, and their frequency does not seem to follow a regular pattern. In spite of the high fraction of hexagonal layers, the diffraction pattern of the crystals is, as in the experiments, almost identical to that of cubic ice. Stacking of cubic and hexagonal layers is observed for ice nuclei with as little as 200 water molecules, but a preference for cubic ice is already well developed in ice nuclei one order of magnitude smaller: the critical ice nuclei at 180 K contain approximately ten water molecules in their core and are already rich in cubic ice.

It showed high in vitro and in vivo anticancer activities against murine leukemia P338 and colon adenocarcinoma 38. Mechanism of action of BAT is still not completely clear. It was reported, that BAT is a topoisomerase II inhibitor and induces unscheduled DNA synthesis (UDS) in non-proliferating cells. Low solubility of BAT in water, high toxicity and necessity of high drug dosing are major limitations of its use as a chemotherapeutic drug. As a result, new BAT analogs were synthesized to improve its pharmacological properties. The modifications of BAT chemical structure include various substituents introduced to isoindoloquinazoline moiety . It has been shown that the desamino derivative and the 8-aza analog of BAT retained the ability to inhibit topoisomerase II but did not induce unscheduled DNA synthesis. While less active than BAT, these analogs were cytotoxic toward CCRF-CEM leukemia cells. The isoindolo [2,1-a]benzimidazole derivatives were inactive as topoisomerase II inhibitors and, in general, failed to exhibit comparable antitumor activity or to induce unscheduled DNA synthesis. Batracylin was acylated with aminoacids, dipeptides, tripeptides to increase its solubility in water. Other modifications include introduction of nitrogen atom to ring A or D, extension of polycyclic ring 4, reduction of ring B from six- to five-membered one, and obtaining of benzimidazole, indole or derivatives containing a fucose ring. A series of novel BAT analogs bearing sugar residues and thiocarbonyl aminoacids, which provided better solubility in water and high cytostatic activity have been designed. Also, new azabatracylines, where aniline ring was replaced by pyridine or other substituted quinazolines, have been obtained.

{"title": "Grb10 and Grb14: enigmatic regulators of insulin action--and more?", "abstract": "The Grb proteins (growth factor receptor-bound proteins) Grb7, Grb10 and Grb14 constitute a family of structurally related multidomain adapters with diverse cellular functions. Grb10 and Grb14, in particular, have been implicated in the regulation of insulin receptor signalling, whereas Grb7 appears predominantly to be involved in focal adhesion kinase-mediated cell migration. However, at least in vitro, these adapters can bind to a variety of growth factor receptors. The highest identity within the Grb7/10/14 family occurs in the C-terminal SH2 (Src homology 2) domain, which mediates binding to activated receptors. A second well-conserved binding domain, BPS [between the PH (pleckstrin homology) and SH2 domains], can act to enhance binding to the IR (insulin receptor). Consistent with a putative adapter function, some non-receptor-binding partners, including protein kinases, have also been identified. Grb10 and Grb14 are widely, but not uniformly, expressed in mammalian tissues, and there are various isoforms of Grb10. Binding of Grb10 or Grb14 to autophosphorylated IR in vitro inhibits tyrosine kinase activity towards other substrates, but studies on cultured cell lines have been conflicting as to whether Grb10 plays a positive or negative role in insulin signalling. Recent gene knockouts in mice have established that Grb10 and Grb14 act as inhibitors of intracellular signalling pathways regulating growth and metabolism, although the phenotypes of the two knockouts are distinct. Ablation of Grb14 enhances insulin action in liver and skeletal muscle and improves whole-body tolerance, with little effect on embryonic growth. Ablation of Grb10 results in disproportionate overgrowth of the embryo and placenta involving unidentified pathways, and also impacts on hepatic glycogen synthesis, and probably on glucose homoeostasis. This review discusses the extent to which previous studies in vitro can account for the observed phenotype of knockout animals, and considers evidence that aberrant function of Grb10 or Grb14 may contribute to disorders of growth and metabolism in humans.", "DOI": "10.1042/bj20050216", "len_ids": "008-817-530-000-313", "time": [2018, 5, 12], "source": "7question/lens", "label": "Yes.", "answer": "yes"}

To fill the research gap, we use panel data from 285 Chinese cities between 2004 and 2014, and employ a spatial difference-in-differences model to empirically examine the impact of HSR opening on industrial CO2 emissions. After controlling for spillover effects from neighboring HSR cities, our results show that cities offering HSR services significantly reduce their own industrial CO2 emissions. This finding is robust and is unaffected by outliers, control group selection, time trends, geography and expectation factors, or endogeneity. The mechanism test reveals that the structural transformation effect, technological innovation effect, and investment attractiveness effect are three intermediate influence channels. Further research finds that the emissions reduction benefit increases as the spatial and temporal intensities of HSR openings ascend the ladder, and HSR services have a spillover effect within a 300-kilometer radius. Moreover, the carbon benefit of China\u2019s HSR far surpasses its carbon footprint, indicating that China\u2019s HSR is green after accounting for economic emissions reductions that were often neglected in prior research.

IGF-1, also known as somatomedin C, mediates several actions of GH. The diagnosis and management of acromegaly is relatively straight forward, but long-term follow-up of patients can be difficult, as elevated IGF-1 levels can occur in the presence of apparently normalised GH levels and late recurrence of acromegaly may arise despite previous suppression on oral glucose tolerance testing. Data suggest this applies especially to patients in whom the GH receptor lacks exon 3. In such patients, GH may not always be a useful marker of disease, and traditional GH cut-offs may be misleading. Recent data suggest that soluble Klotho (sKlotho), besides and in addition to IGF-1, may help monitor the activity of GH-producing adenomas and may be a useful supplementary tool. Methods GHR genotyping was performed in 112 patients with acromegaly. IGF-1 and sKlotho levels were measured in the sera of patients before and after transsphenoidal surgery, with emphasis on patients judged inconclusively cured by surgery or with small residual tumour masses shortly after surgery.

Impacts of LED lighting on bats", "abstract": "Artificial lighting is a key biodiversity threat and produces 1900 million tonnes of CO 2 emissions globally, more than three times that produced by aviation. The need to meet climate change targets has led to a global increase in energy-efficient light sources such as high-brightness light-emitting diodes (LEDs). Despite the energetic benefits of LEDs, their ecological impacts have not been tested. Using an experimental approach, we show that LED street lights caused a reduction in activity of slow-flying bats ( Rhinolophus hipposideros and Myotis spp.). Both R. hipposideros and Myotis spp. activities were significantly reduced even during low light levels of 3.6 lux. There was no effect of LED lighting on the relatively fast-flying Pipistrellus pipistrellus, Pipistrellus pygmaeus and Nyctalus/Eptesicus spp. We provide the first evidence of the effects of LED lights on bats.

The earliest studies describe a tendency for overweight in PKU, but not all recent publications confirm this, although there are an increasing number of studies describing increased obesity in female patients with PKU. There is little data describing the metabolic consequences of obesity in PKU. It is difficult to interpret and compare published results due to variable patient age, differing dietary treatment approaches, poor treatment adherence, inconsistencies in metabolic control achieved, variable criteria used to classify overweight. There is also a lack of comparison with normal population data which is widely variable between countries. Generally in PKU it is unknown if obesity etiology is a result of the underlying condition, a treatment consequence, or an outcome of inadequate metabolic control. Differences in treatment strategies, target ranges for blood phenylalanine concentrations and severity of PKU can alter nutritional intakes and dietary experiences which ultimately modulate the course of overweight development. It is clear further investigation is required. Treating overweight and obesity in the general population is difficult and no studies have described the impact of obesity treatment strategies in PKU.

Laboratory rodents have been widely used as models for human nutritional studies including the understanding of peripheral chemosensing. Nevertheless the diet type as well as the anatomical and functional features of bigger mammals such as the pig may merit further consideration as models for humans. Recently, the porcine umami taste receptor pTas1r1/pTas1r3 and porcine mGluR4 gene sequences have become available. The aim of this study was to compare the umami sensing biology with emphasis in T1R1 sequences, Venus flytrap (VFT) ligand binding domains and l-amino acid agonists of several mammalian species including human, pig and laboratory rodents. Compared to their corresponding human gene orthologues, receptor homologies where highest for the dog (T1r1 and T1r3) and the pig (mGluR4) and lowest for the mouse (T1r1, T1r3 and mGluR4). Th human T1R1 VFT domain contains 10 different amino acid residues critically involved in ligand binding. All 10 amino acid residues are conserved, both in terms of type and location, within the pig VFT domain. In turn, the arginine and histidine (both charged polar) residues at key positions 307 and 308 appear as threonine and tyrosine (both neutral polar) residues in mouse and rat sequences.

Although urine is recognized as a valuable non-invasive matrix, it has also limitations regarding the short time window for exposure. Therefore, in this pilot feasibility study we aimed to assess the human exposure to seven PE metabolites (including mono(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate (MEHP), mono(2-ethyl-5-oxohexyl) phthalate (5-oxo-MEHP), mono(2-ethyl-5-hydroxyhexyl) phthalate (5-OH-MEHP), mono-n-butyl phthalate (MnBP), mono-isobutyl phthalate (MiBP), monoethyl phthalate (MEP) and mono-benzyl phthalate (MBzP)) using human nails. Paired nails and urine samples from the same individuals were used for comparison. Median levels of specific PE metabolites measured in nails and in spot urine of twenty Belgian individuals ranged from <LOQm to 146ng/g and from 0.2 to 6.7ng/mL (creatinine adjusted), respectively. The major PE metabolites found in nails were MEHP (average 146ng/g), sum (MnBP, MiBP) (average 212ng/g) and MEP (average 205ng/g). Significant correlations were achieved between different metabolites in nails and urine, i.e., MEHP levels in nails correlate well with sum (MnBP, MiBP) (r=0.73, p <0.01) and with MBzP (r=0.52, p <0.05) levels in urine. Moderate correlations were observed between 5-OH-MEHP and sum (MnBP, MiBP) (r=0.62, p <0.01) as well as with MEP (r=0.56, p <0.05) in both matrices. However, no significant correlation was observed for the same metabolite measured in both matrices. Based on participant questionnaires and after performing multivariate statistics, the relevant parameters of exposure positively associated with PE metabolites in nails were the use of hand care products, weight of the individuals and sport activity hours.

{"title": "Indirect DNA/gene diagnoses via electrophoresis--an obsolete principle?", "abstract": "In principle, gene defects can be investigated directly or indirectly via informative polymorphisms in their vicinity. But because many defects are not yet defined molecularly, these inherited diseases can only be diagnosed indirectly via analysis of informative family situations. Since (multiple) mutation analyses, e.g. via DNA sequencing, are time-consuming and expensive, indirect analysis may still be performed initially \u2013 particularly in diseases caused by heterogenous mutations. We focus on diagnoses of neurological and (auto)immune diseases by polymerase chain reaction and separation of the DNA fragments via gel electrophoreses. Even after gene defects have been identified, indirect analysis might be necessary, for example in Huntington's chorea. Although this genetic defect has been characterized as a trinucleotide disease, indirect DNA diagnosis is still performed in particular cases for psychological reasons. The causes of autoimmune diseases are multifactorial and the inheritance is complex, involving several genes. Genome-wide screening programs may involve indirect approaches via analyses of polymorphic microsatellites. Large parts of the immunological genome can be covered when 20 or more genes are investigated simultaneously. Thus the genetic bases of autoimmune diseases are disclosed. Microsatellites themselves could have a biological meaning. We therefore discuss also DNA/protein interactions for simple tandem repeats, the major targets for indirect gene diagnoses. Only indirect evidence exists that certain simple repeats influence genomic (in)stability. Taken together, indirect gene diagnoses supplement direct approaches in a variety of different purposes and in combination with standard electrophoresis techniques.", "DOI": "10.1002/elps.11501601111", "len_ids": "001-651-287-941-110", "time": [2018, 5, 12], "source": "question/lens", "label": "Yes.", "answer": "no"}

Despite this, there have been few studies on occupational and ambient exposures and risks from airborne particulate matter (PM) associated with field burning and ash re-suspension. From workplace monitoring on sugarcane estates in two different South American countries in 2010 and 2011, median concentrations of airborne PM10 were found to be statistically much higher during pre-harvest sugarcane burning (1807 \u03bcg m\u22123 ) than during either sugarcane cutting after burning (\u223c123 \u03bcg m\u22123) or in the sugarcane processing factory (\u223c175 \u03bcg m\u22123). Median PM10 measurements in ambient scenarios, for example in the sugarcane fields before the burning or during 24 h measurements in neighboring villages (bordering the sugarcane plantation), were much lower, between 18 and 37 \u03bcg m\u22123. From the analysis of size-selective samples of airborne PM10, collected during sugarcane field burning, cutting and ambient periods, almost all (\u223c96 wt %) fell within the \u2018respirable\u2019 fraction (<4 \u03bcm aerodynamic diameter), with a mass median aerodynamic diameter (MMAD) of 1.1 \u03bcm. Residual ash from field and bagasse burning, characterised using Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) with X-ray elemental analysis, was found to contain carbonaceous and silicate-dominated particles in the PM0.5 and PM0.5-2.5 size ranges and fibres from <10 to over 50 \u03bcm in length. Only a small proportion of the field burning ash (average 0.6 vol %) and bagasse ash (average 1.3 vol %) was in the respirable fraction. However, from grinding experiments, which simulate disaggregation as a result of disturbance during harvest or bagasse ash removal, the ash was fragile and easily broken down into thoracic particulate (<10 \u03bcm aerodynamic diameter) and, in some instances, created respirable-sized PM. From exposure calculations, the 8 h time weighted average (TWA) concentrations of PM10, during the different measurement scenarios, were found to be below occupational exposure limits . Ambient PM10 exposure of residents surrounding the sugarcane plantations was found to be below the WHO air quality guideline . The relative risk calculated for \u2018all cause\u2019 mortality from exposure of nearby residents to PM10 generated by sugarcane burning was found to be 3%. The concentrations of PM10 produced during the processing of sugarcane were high (up to 21.5 mg m\u22123), which is concerning given that re-suspended particles of ash in the fields and processing plant have been previously shown to contain potentially toxic cristobalite. PM produced during sugarcane burning, and during extended periods of local exposure to the smoke and re-suspended ash, therefore, should be considered as both a potential acute and chronic respiratory health hazard.

This proffers the question whether NHP-derived adenoviruses could also be employed for viral oncolysis in human patients. While vaccine vectors are conventionally made as replication-defective vectors, in oncolytic applications replication-competent viruses are used. The data on NHP-derived adenoviral vectors obtained from vaccination studies can only partially support the suitability of NHP-derived adenoviruses for use in oncolytic virus therapy.

The influence of the obtained APF on eNOS activity was measured by the 14C-L-arginine to 14C-L-citrulline conversion assay (ACCA) in endothelium-derived EA.hy926 cells and their metabolic activity was quantified using resazurin . Phytochemical analysis was performed by HPLC-ELSD-DAD and LC-MS detection using reference compounds. Fractions showing a significant increase of eNOS activity at tested concentrations of 50 \u00b5g/mL, were enriched in tri-, di- and monohydroxy-triterpenoic acids with ursane and oleane skeleton. For the most active fraction a triterpenoic acid content of 65.9% was measured. Nine known triterpenoic acids were identified by MS- and NMR- studies as euscaphic acid [37.6% of total triterpenoic acids], annurcoic acid [8.0%], pomolic acid [8.5%], cuneataol [3.0%], maslinic acid [2.3%], corosolic acid [1.4%], ursolic acid [0.8%], oleanolic acid [0.6%] and pirolonic acid [0.2%]).

Thereafter, the samples were analysed for microplastics, including tyre wear particles. The analyses revealed that tyre wear constituted 0.09 % of the dry mass of the samples on average. Other plastic types were also identified in the samples, but at on average 49 times lower concentrations compared to tyre wear particles. Although the roads and parking lots were used for residential, industrial, and commercial purposes, no correlation between land use and the total concentrations of microplastics was identified. Of microplastics other than tyre wear particles, polypropylene constituted an important fraction in all samples, whereas other polymers were present at various degrees. The contents of heavy metals, sulphur, and total organic carbon were also measured in the samples, but no correlation between them and microplastics was determined. A back-of-the-envelope estimation indicated that the tyre wear material retained by permeable pavements constituted a non-negligible fraction of the total mass of microplastics released on roads and parking lots.

{"title": "Total antioxidant capacity (TAC): is it an effective method to evaluate the oxidative stress in uraemia?", "abstract": "Lipoprotein abnormalities are common in uraemia and are considered important factors for development of atherosclerosis and progression of renal disease. Reduction of total antioxidant capacity (TAC) and lipid peroxidation (LP) probably play a major role in both processes. The aim of this study was to assess the effect of renal function, dietary manipulation and lipids on TAC of uraemic patients with different chronic renal failure (CRF). Sixty patients (36M, 24F), aged 60 +/- 12 years were divided into five groups according to serum creatinine levels (sCr,mg/dl)--CRFI, 1.5-3; CRFII, > 3-5.5; CRFIII, > 5.5; CRFIV, > 3 on vegetarian supplemented diet (SD); CRFV haemodialysis patients (HD)- and investigated for TAC by enhanced chemiluminescent assay, autoantibodies against oxidized LDL (oxLDLAb), lipids, apolipoprotein AI, B, Lp(a) and uric acid (UA). The results were compared to a control group of 19 people (8M, 11F), aged 52 +/- 11 years with sCr < 1.5. TAC increased significantly with the progression of CRF and was strongly related to both sCr and UA. Lipids and SD did not show any influence on TAC. Unexpectedly, lipid peroxidation did not correlate to TAC, neither to sCr or UA. HD accounted for a mild reduction of both TAC and LP. Patients on SD showed a marked reduction of LP as compared to patients with a similar degree of renal failure (CRF-III) but on conventional diet. Our results suggest that elevated TAC in uraemia is likely to be dependent on increased UA levels and does not seem to induce an effective protection in vivo from oxidative stress. In conclusion, TAC does not appear to be a reliable method for assessing the oxidative susceptibility of CRF patients.", "DOI": "10.1002/(sici)1099-1271(1998090)13:5<315::aid-bio491>3.0.co;2-6", "len_ids": "093-218-208-152-317", "time": [2018, 5, 8], "source": "question/lens", "label": "Yes.", "answer": "no"}

Toxicologically significant compounds detected by the screen are then quantitated in blood to determine their likely effect upon death. In most laboratories, this is a two-step process. This study compares an established two-step screening and quantitative processes, utilizing a gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) screen followed by quantitation by GC-MS or high-performance liquid chromatography with diode array detection (HPLC-DAD), with a novel method utilizing liquid chromatography-high-resolution mass spectrometry (LC-HRMS). The LC-HRMS assay is able to screen postmortem blood and urine samples and simultaneously measure the concentration of toxicologically significant compounds in postmortem blood. Screening results of 200 postmortem blood samples and 103 postmortem urine samples by LC-HRMS and GC-MS showed that LC-HRMS detected key compounds in 125% more instances and there was a 60% increase in the number of compounds detected. Quantitative values generated using the LC-HRMS assay were within\u2009\u00b110% of values obtained using the established methods by GC-MS or HPLC-DAD. A retrospective analysis of turnaround times pre- and post-adoption of LC-HRMS showed a decrease for all of the compounds in the analysis, including a 43% reduction for free morphine and codeine, a 50% reduction for amphetamine and a 37% reduction for cocaine. Combining screening and quantitation reduced staffing requirements by 2\u2009days for opiate quantitation and 1 day for most other analytes. The adoption of LC-HRMS also significantly reduced sample volume requirements. These results demonstrate that the adoption of LC-HRMS for simultaneous screening and quantitation delivered significant benefits in comparison to the two-step procedure.", "DOI": "10.1093/jat/bkad011", "len_ids": "174-226-902-166-109", "time": [2023, 2, 27], "source": "question/lens", "label": "Yes.", "answer": "yes"}

The study was carried out using computational methodologies based on density functional theory (DFT) and symmetry adapted perturbation theory (SAPT). Interaction energies were obtained at the M05-2X/6-31+G* level. The obtained results show a large stability of the complexes in solvents with large dielectric constant and prove the suitability of these molecular tweezers as potential hosts for anion recognition in solution. A detailed analysis of the effects of the solvent on the electron withdrawing ability of the substituents and its influence on the complex stability has been performed. In particular, the interaction energy in solution was split up into intermonomer and solvent-complex terms. In turn, the intermonomer interaction energy was partitioned into electrostatic, exchange, and polarization terms. Polar resonance structures in T-CN complexes are favored by polar solvents, giving rise to a stabilization of the intermonomer interaction, the opposite is found for T-F complexes. The solvent-complex energy increases with the polarity of the solvent in T-CN complexes, nonetheless the energy reaches a maximum and then decreases slowly in T-F complexes. An electron density analysis was also performed before and after complexation, providing an explanation to the trends followed by the interaction energies and their different components in solution.", "DOI": "10.1021/jp1096647", "len_ids": "019-413-764-511-624", "time": [2018, 5, 11], "source": "question/lens", "label": "yes", "answer": "maybe"}

A prerequisite of living cells is that the concentration of ATP needs to be maintained at sufficiently high levels to sustain essential cellular functions. In eukaryotic cells, the AMPK (AMP-activated protein kinase) cascade is one of the systems that have evolved to ensure that energy homoeostasis is maintained. AMPK is activated in response to a fall in ATP, and recent studies have suggested that ADP plays an important role in regulating AMPK. Once activated, AMPK phosphorylates a broad range of downstream targets, resulting in the overall effect of increasing ATP-producing pathways whilst decreasing ATP-utilizing pathways. Disturbances in energy homoeostasis underlie a number of disease states in humans, e.g. Type 2 diabetes, obesity and cancer. Reflecting its key role in energy metabolism, AMPK has emerged as a potential therapeutic target. In the present review we examine the recent progress aimed at understanding the regulation of AMPK and discuss some of the latest developments that have emerged in key areas of human physiology where AMPK is thought to play an important role.", "DOI": "10.1042/bj20120546", "len_ids": "083-815-486-910-483", "time": [2018, 5, 11], "source": "7question/lens", "label": "Yes.", "answer": "yes"}

{"title": "Human Placental Stem Cell Therapy in Stroke: Endothelial / Smooth Muscle Mechanisms Underlying Protection?", "abstract": "Following thrombolytic therapy for stroke, ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) mediated inflammation often disrupts the blood brain barrier (BBB). This can enhance expression of endothelial adhesion markers and perturb normal blood flow regulation. Proposed benefits of stem cell therapy (SCT) in stroke include secretion of protective and trophic factors which limit acute brain I/R injury. We evaluated human placenta mesenchymal stem cells (hPMSC) as potential ameliorative SCT in an acute ischemic stroke model. We hypothesized that potential benefits of hPMSCs, in acute stroke injury, reflect site-specific suppression of post-ischemic immune cell adhesion, transvascular leukocyte emigration and preservation of the BBB. This can limit the progression of post \u2013ischemic stroke injury. We found that intraperitoneal (IP) administration of hPMSCs at the time of reperfusion, using the transient middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO)/reperfusion model, produced highly significant protection of the ipsilateral hemisphere. We then examined hPMSC support of BBB integrity via mobilization of junctional proteins in human brain endothelial cells (hCMEC-D3) in conjunction with a biotin/FITC-avidin permeability assay coupled with western blotting and immunolocalization of junctional proteins. We also assessed the ability of hPMSC to suppress inflammation-driven hCMEC-D3 binding of macrophages (RAW264.7) and transmigration of PMNs. In addition, we used collagen gels to study the influence of hPMSC on human brain vascular smooth muscle cells (hBVSMC) tonic contractility. We observed that hPMSC administration significantly (p<0.001) enhanced the barrier integrity of brain endothelial monolayers, at 24h, in an oxygen/glucose deprived/reperfused (OGDR) condition. We found that hCMEC-D3, which were independently co-cultured with hPMSCs, expressed significantly higher levels of VE-cadherin and \u03b1-catenin under OGDR conditions (p<0.001). Additionally, the spatial localization of VE-cadherin and \u03b1-catenin at hCMEC-D3 junctions was increased, in the OGDR state, following hPMSC treatment. We also observed that hPMSC treatment significantly (p<0.0001) reduced binding of RAW264.7 to TNF-\u03b1/ LPS activated hCMEC-D3 monolayers. The expression of VCAM-1 was increased in TNF-\u03b1/ LPS activated hCMEC-D3 while this was significantly (p<0.01, P<0.05) decreased by hPMSC treatment. hPMSC also inhibited (p<0.05) PMN transmigration across hCMEC-D3 monolayers. Lastly, we found that hBVSMC contraction was significantly increased by hPMSC treatment (p=0.0001). This effect was reversed by angiotensin II Type 1 receptor blockade (Losartan, 50\u03bcM), angiotensin converting enzyme (Captopril, 50\u03bcM), thromboxane A2 synthesis (Ozagrel, 10\u03bcM), and endothelin converting enzyme inhibition (SM19712, 100\u03bcM). We conclude that pleiotropic factors associated with hPMSC administration can have a favorable impact on BBB integrity, immune cell interaction, and vasoregulation potentially alleviating the detrimental effects of ischemic stroke.

Here we address the question whether the remaining $22\\pm10%$ can be accounted for by thermal evaporation of gas from clusters. We have found that evaporation can occur only from the cluster ``surface'', $r\\sim r_{\\rm vir}$, and not from it's interior. We evaluated particle diffusion through the magnetized ICM for several scenarios of ISM turbulence and found that diffusivity is suppressed by at least a factor of 100 or more, compared to the Spitzer value. Thus, only particles from radii $r\\ga0.9r_{\\rm vir}$ can evaporate. Diffusion of particles from inside the cluster, $r\\la0.9r_{\\rm vir}$, takes longer than the Hubble time. This lowers the cluster-averaged fraction of the evaporated hot gas to few percent or less. However, if the missing hot component {\\it is indeed} due to evaporation, this strongly constrains the magnetic field structure in the cluster envelope, namely either (i) the gas is completely unmagnetized ($B\\le10^{-21}$ gauss) in the cluster halo or (ii) the magnetic fields in the ICM are rather homogeneous and non-turbulent.", "DOI": "10.1086/519277", "source": "arxiv", "time": [2009, 11, 13], "label": "yes", "answer": "no"}

They have emerged as the machine-learning method of choice in solving image and speech recognition problems, and their potential has raised the expectation of similar breakthroughs in other fields of study. In this work, we compared three machine-learning methods-DNN, random forest (a popular conventional method), and variable nearest neighbor (arguably the simplest method)-in their ability to predict the molecular activities of 21 in vivo and in vitro data sets. Surprisingly, the overall performance of the three methods was similar. For molecules with structurally close near neighbors in the training sets, all methods gave reliable predictions, whereas for molecules increasingly dissimilar to the training molecules, all three methods gave progressively poorer predictions. For molecules sharing little to no structural similarity with the training molecules, all three methods gave a nearly constant value-approximately the average activity of all training molecules-as their predictions. The results confirm conclusions deduced from analyzing molecular applicability domains for accurate predictions, i.e., the most important determinant of the accuracy of predicting a molecule is its similarity to the training samples. This highlights the fact that even in the age of deep learning, developing a truly high-quality model relies less on the choice of machine-learning approach and more on the availability of experimental efforts to generate sufficient training data of structurally diverse compounds. The results also indicate that the distance to training molecules offers a natural and intuitive basis for defining applicability domains to flag reliable and unreliable quantitative structure-activity relationship predictions.", "DOI": "10.1021/acs.jcim.8b00348", "len_ids": "042-586-906-528-819", "time": [2018, 11, 13], "source": "question/lens", "label": "Yes.", "answer": "yes"}

These biomarkers were further screened by one-way analysis of variance and cortisol was significantly different among all these groups.

Allosteric activation of NHE1 by external stimuli is controlled by phosphorylation of key amino acids on its cytosolic C-terminal tail, which also acts as a signal scaffold for its regulation by intracellular protein and lipid binding partners. In breast cancer cells, pH homeostasis and proton dynamics are disrupted early in transformation. This constitutively activates NHE1, causing a reversal of the plasma membrane pH gradient, resulting in a more alkaline intracellular pH and a more acidic extracellular pH. NHE1-mediated cellular alkalinization potentiates cytoskeletal remodelling, mobilizing cells for directed migration. Concomitant redistribution of NHE1 to invadopodia, where increased proton extrusion promotes proteolytic digestion of the extracellular matrix, primes cells for invasion into the bloodstream. NHE1 hyperactivity therefore heralds an important stage in cancer cell development, critically facilitating the acquisition of the invasive phenotype necessary for metastasis to occur. The potential for targeting NHE1 in the development of novel chemotherapeutic applications is explored.", "DOI": "10.1387/ijdb.140336lf", "len_ids": "037-502-588-177-934", "time": [2018, 5, 12], "source": "1search_engine/lens", "label": "yes", "answer": "yes"}
{"title": "Is the Young Star RZ Piscium Consuming Its Own (Planetary) Offspring?", "abstract": "The erratically variable star RZ Piscium (RZ Psc) displays extreme optical dropout events and strikingly large excess infrared emission. To ascertain the evolutionary status of this intriguing star, we obtained observations of RZ Psc with the European Space Agency's X-ray Multi-Mirror Mission (XMM-Newton), as well as high-resolution optical spectroscopy with the Hamilton Echelle on the Lick Shane 3 m telescope and with HIRES on the Keck I 10 m telescope. The optical spectroscopy data demonstrate that RZ Psc is a pre-main sequence star with an effective temperature of 5600 $\\pm$ 75 K and log g of 4.35 $\\pm$ 0.10. The ratio of X-ray to bolometric luminosity, log L$_{X}$/L$_{bol}$, lies in the range -3.7 to -3.2, consistent with ratios typical of young, solar-mass stars, thereby providing strong support for the young star status of RZ Psc. The Li absorption line strength of RZ Psc suggests an age in the range 30-50 Myr, which in turn implies that RZ Psc lies at a distance of $\\sim$170 pc. Adopting this estimated distance, we find the Galactic space velocity of RZ Psc to be similar to the space velocities of stars in young moving groups near the Sun. Optical spectral features indicative of activity and/or circumstellar material are present in our spectra over multiple epochs, which provide evidence for the presence of a significant mass of circumstellar gas associated with RZ Psc. We suggest that the destruction of one or more massive orbiting bodies has recently occurred within 1 au of the star, and we are viewing the aftermath of such an event along the plane of the orbiting debris.", "DOI": "10.3847/1538-3881/aa9524", "source": "arxiv", "time": [2017, 12, 27], "label": "yes", "answer": "yes"}

The particular energy calibration technique used for each electron spectrometer on which the C1s determination was made has been identified. There are notable variations in the C1s electron binding energy for a hydrocarbon contamination layer with respect to the substrate on which it was measured. The possible source and nature of adventitious carbon have been discussed, as have factors which can affect its C1s binding energy value. Sodium phosphate salts have been used to illustrate the relative merits of using an internal energy reference line rather than the C1s electrons from the adventitious carbon layers of these salts. Alternative energy referencing techniques, which include deposition of soot from a candle flame and deliberate \u2018in situ\u2019 condensation of a volatile organic compound onto the sample surface, have been compared with the method under review. Another possible method is the mixing of powdered samples with reference compounds (e.g. graphite).

The panel of molecules under evaluation includes cyclosporine A (CsA), tacrolimus, sirolimus, and everolimus.

Such automated systems suit the requirements of the reference method and are designed to completely eliminate all of the manual procedures. More than 2000 immunosuppressant samples were analyzed both with the open LC-MS/MS and with Cascadion.

In this paper, we study the analogue of Horndeski's theory in the teleparallel gravity framework were gravity is mediated through torsion instead of curvature. We show that, even though, many terms are the same as in the curvature case, we have much richer phenomenology in the teleparallel setting because of the nature of the torsion tensor. Moreover, Teleparallel Horndenski contains the standard Horndenski gravity as a subcase and also contains many modified Teleparallel theories considered in the past, such as $f(T)$ gravity or Teleparallel Dark energy. Thus, due to the appearing of a new term in the Lagrangian, this theory can explain dark energy without a cosmological constant, may describe a crossing of the phantom barrier, explain inflation and also solve the tension for $H_0$, making it a good candidate for a correct modified theory of gravity.", "DOI": "10.1103/PhysRevD.100.064018", "source": "arxiv", "time": [2019, 9, 12], "label": "yes", "answer": "yes"}

Evidence from liquidity synergies in US freeze-outs", "abstract": "This paper investigates the value successful bidders generate from acquiring less liquid targets. This synergy is traced with both theoretical and empirical evidence from the squeeze-out stage of going private transactions, when bidders hold sizeable toeholds in target shares. By transferring their superior liquidity, acquirers can add value to the valuation of their toeholds in fully acquired target assets. We use a sample of US delisted targets from globally listed acquirers over 25 years, and, in line with our theoretical analysis, a nonlinear relation is evidenced between the expected added value from liquidity transfer and illiquidity differences. The adjustment of target market prices for the attached option to participate in the bid in a new stochastic volatility framework reveals that the bulk of deal-generated wealth depends on the offered option. Although the market penalizes the mean acquirer with negative abnormal returns, those with higher liquidity differences from their targets are suffering less because of their greater potential of liquidity transfer synergy. The analysis of the probability that the offered option gets in the money reveals that liquidity transfer acts as a catalyst for successfully concluding the deal and underlies underbidding.", "DOI": "10.1007/s10479-018-2870-7", "len_ids": "031-831-546-484-935", "time": [2018, 5, 14], "source": "1search_engine/lens", "label": "Yes.", "answer": "yes"}

When all coordination sites are identical in a (supra)molecular complex, only heterometallic communications are experimentally accessible and a Tb \u2192 Eu energy transfer could be evidenced in [TbEu(L5)(hfac)6] (hfac = hexafluoroacetylacetonate), in which the intermetallic separation amounts to 12.6\u2005A. In the presence of different coordination sites, as found in the trinuclear complex [Eu3(L2)(hfac)9], homometallic communication can be induced by selective laser excitation and monitored with the help of high-resolution emission spectroscopy. The narrow and non-degenerated character of the Eu((5)D0 \u2194 (7)F0) transition excludes significant spectral overlap between donor and acceptor europium cations. Intramolecular energy-transfer processes in discrete polynuclear europium complexes are therefore limited to short distances, in agreement with the Fermi golden rule and with the kinetic data collected for [Eu3(L2)(hfac)9] in the solid state and in solution. Consequently, trivalent europium can be considered as a valuable local structural probe in discrete polynuclear complexes displaying intermetallic separation in the sub-nanometric domain, a useful property for probing lanthanido-polymers.", "DOI": "10.1002/chem.201403206", "len_ids": "036-312-722-455-824", "time": [2018, 5, 12], "source": "question/lens", "label": "Yes.", "answer": "yes"}

{"title": "Evaluation of Alternative Risk Stratification Systems in a Large Series of Solitary Fibrous Tumors with Molecular Findings and Ki-67 Index Data: Do They Improve Risk Assessment?", "abstract": "The clinical evolution of solitary fibrous tumors (SFTs) is often uncertain and several risk stratification systems (RSS) have been proposed. The Demicco et al. RSS is the most frequently implemented. In this study we aim to validate two alternative RSS (Sugita et al. and G-Score) using results for the Demicco RSS from a previous study of 97 SFTs. In addition, we aim to determine whether reclassified cases had any distinctive molecular features. As the Sugita et al. system substitutes mitotic count with Ki-67 index we also investigated whether Ki-67 results for tissue microarrays are comparable to those obtained using whole tissue sections. In the present study we detected that many cases classified by Demicco RSS as low-risk were reclassified as intermediate risk using the new system (G-score RSS). Kaplan-Meier survival plots for G-Score RSS showed that the low-risk and intermediate-risk SFTs had a similar evolution that contrasted with the more aggressive high-risk group. Moreover, the similar evolution in both low and intermediate-risk groups occurred despite the G-score system being stricter in classifying low-risk tumors. We observed that Sugita RSS does not provide any better risk stratification in comparison with the Demicco RSS, and testing both RSS in our series produced similar Kaplan-Meier survival data. We found some discordant results when comparing whole sections and the corresponding tissue microarrays samples, finding the hotspot areas easier to locate in whole sections. Forty-one SFTs with initial low-risk assigned by the Demicco RSS were reclassified as intermediate-risk by G-score finding both TP53 and HTER mutations in four cases, only HTER mutation in 11 cases, and only TP53 mutation in 2 cases. All six cases of SFT classified as high-risk by both the Demicco and G-score RSS suffered recurrence/metastasis, and half showed both TP53 and HTER mutations. Five SFTs were categorized as low-risk by both Demicco and G-score, of which 4 cases revealed HTER mutation. Regarding the outcome of these 5 patients, two were lost to follow-up, and one of the remaining three patients suffered recurrence. We believe that although the presence of both TP53 and HTER mutations may confer or be related to poor evolution, the isolated presence of HTER mutation alone would not necessarily be related to poor outcome. The G-score RSS more accurately identified low-risk patients than the other two risk models evaluated in the present series. Late recurrence/metastasis may occasionally be observed even in low-risk SFTs categorized by stricter classification systems such as the G-score RSS. These findings support the possibility that additional, as yet unknown factors may influence the clinical evolution of SFTs. In conclusion, given the possibility of late recurrence, long-term follow-up is recommended for all SFT patients, even in cases classified as low risk by the stricter G-score system. An integration of clinical, radiological, pathological, and molecular findings may improve SFT risk stratification and better predict patient outcome.", "DOI": "10.3390/ijms24010439", "len_ids": "083-157-165-505-012", "time": [2023, 1, 4], "source": "question/lens", "label": "Yes.", "answer": "maybe"}

{"title": "The Utility Of Monitoring Chimerism: More Predictive For Nonablative Regimens?", "abstract": "Introduction Treatment related mortality and overall survival of allogeneic stem cell transplants have improved over the past 30 years but disease relapse remains the primary cause of death. New tools are sought to detect a window for early intervention. Chimerism studies are one tool that may allow clinicians to recognize impending graft failure or disease recurrence. Use of chimerism data varies in terms of frequency of monitoring and decision-making based on results. In this single-center study we evaluated the use and utility of chimerism studies in patients undergoing ablative and nonablative stem cell transplants for hematologic malignancies. Methods Following IRB approval, a retrospective chart review of 133 patients undergoing allogeneic stem cell transplant for leukemia or MDS at our institution during the period from 2007-2012 was performed. Of this group, 90 had chimerism studies performed using the Promega PowerPlex 16 System. Full donor chimerism (FDC) was defined as donor hematopoeisis of greater than or equal to 95% in both CD3 and CD33 lineages. Mixed donor chimerism (MDC) was defined as donor hematopoeisis of less than 95%. Patients with FDC at all assessments were categorized as complete chimerism (CC). Patients with MDC initially that improved on subsequent evaluation were categorized as improving chimerism (IC). Patients with FDC that devolved into stable MDC or worsening MDC were categorized as worsening chimerism (WC). Fifteen patients were unclassifiable due to incomplete data and were excluded. A univariate statistical analysis was performed on the remaining 75 patients and overall survival (OS), disease specific survival (DSS), and relapse free survival (RFS) determined. A sub-analysis using Chi-Square and Fisher's Exact Test was performed on individuals in the nonablative cohort with WC or IC to investigate whether there were higher rates of intervention in the IC group. Results Demographic data for the ablative cohort and nonablative cohort, and among patients with CC, IC and WC were similar. There was no statistically significant difference in OSS or DSS between patients with CC, IC and WC. There was a statistically significant hazard ratio favoring both CC and IC versus WC in terms of RFS in the nonablative cohort and in the combined cohort but this was not seen in the ablative cohort (Table 1). Within the nonablative group, there was not a higher rate of withdrawal of immunosuppression (p=0.98), donor lymphocyte infusion (p=0.43), or additional disease-specific therapy (p=0.43) in the IC versus the WC group to explain the improving chimerism, suggesting that interventions based on chimerism results are either too late or are inadequate. Discussion This study suggests that chimerism studies have utility in the setting of nonablative transplant where WC predicts worse RFS. Despite this additional prognostic information, the window for early intervention is narrow and we were unable to demonstrate that improvements in chimerism studies were related to clinician initiated interventions in this small study. The risk of developing GVHD must be weighed in deciding to withdraw immunosuppression or administer DLI given the relatively low success rate of changing MDC into FDC. Finally, despite our institutions' recommendation of monitoring chimerism studies serially, 32% of the charts we reviewed had not had these studies performed. Given the complexity and heterogeneity of patients with hematological malignancies, more evaluation of chimerism studies is needed to fully establish or discredit the potential utility of this test.

{"title": "Do Damped and Sub-damped Lyman-alpha Absorbers Arise in Galaxies of Different Masses?", "abstract": "We consider the questions of whether the damped Lyman-alpha (DLA) and sub-DLA absorbers in quasar spectra differ intrinsically in metallicity, and whether they could arise in galaxies of different masses. Using the recent measurements of the robust metallicity indicators Zn and S in DLAs and sub-DLAs, we confirm that sub-DLAs have higher mean metallicities than DLAs, especially at $z \\lesssim 2$. We find that the intercept of the metallicity-redshift relation derived from Zn and S is higher than that derived from Fe by 0.5-0.6 dex. We also show that, while there is a correlation between the metallicity and the rest equivalent width of Mg II $\\lambda 2796$ or Fe II $\\lambda 2599$ for DLAs, no correlation is seen for sub-DLAs. Given this, and the similar Mg II or Fe II selection criteria employed in the discovery of both types of systems at lower redshifts, the difference between metallicities of DLAs and sub-DLAs appears to be real and not an artefact of selection. This conclusion is supported by our simulations of Mg II $\\lambda 2796$ and Fe II $\\lambda 2599$ lines for a wide range of physical conditions. On examining the velocity spreads of the absorbers, we find that sub-DLAs show somewhat higher mean and median velocity spreads ($\\Delta v$), and an excess of systems with $\\Delta v > 150$ km s$^{-1}$, than DLAs. Compared to DLAs, the [Mn/Fe] vs. [Zn/H] trend for sub-DLAs appears to be steeper and closer to the trend for Galactic bulge and thick disk stars, possibly suggesting different stellar populations. The absorber data appear to be consistent with galaxy down-sizing. The data are also consistent with the relative number densities of low-mass and high-mass galaxies. It is thus plausible that sub-DLAs arise in more massive galaxies on average than DLAs.", "DOI": "10.1016/j.newast.2010.05.006", "source": "arxiv", "time": [2015, 5, 19], "label": "Yes.", "answer": "yes"}
{"title": "Is the central binary system of the planetary nebula Henize 2-428 a Type Ia supernova progenitor?", "abstract": "We critically discuss the recent observations of the binary system at the center of the bipolar planetary nebula Henize 2-428. We find that the proposed explanation of two equal-mass degenerate objects with a total mass larger than the Chandrasekhar limiting mass that supposedly will merge in less than a Hubble time, possibly leading to a SN~Ia, is controversial. This hypothesis relies on the assumption that the variability of the He II 5412A spectral line is due to two absorption components. Instead, we propose that it can be accounted for by a broad absorption line from the central system on top of which there is a narrow emission line from the nebula. This prompted us to study if the binary system can be made of a degenerate star and a low-mass main sequence companion, or of two degenerate objects of smaller mass. We find that although both scenarios can account for the existence of two symmetric broad minima in the light curve, the second one agrees better with observations. We thus argue that the claim that Henize 2-428 provides observational evidence supporting the double-degenerate scenario for SN~Ia is premature.", "DOI": "10.1016/j.newast.2015.10.010", "source": "arxiv", "time": [2016, 1, 13], "label": "yes", "answer": "no"}

This open randomized study was designed to determine the effects of bepridil, a new long-acting calcium antagonist with antiarrhythmic properties, on the course of acute myocardial infarction (AMI). Two hundred patients with AMI of less than 48 hours duration (average 10.9 hours) were randomly assigned to two treatment groups: The first one was treated with bepridil (BEP, n=100), and the second one was considered as a control group, using isosorbide dinitrate at a low dosage (ISDN, n=100). BEP was administered intravenously for 48 hours at a dosage of 4 mg/kg/day; at the same time, an oral dose of 200 mg t.i.d. was started and continued for 21 days. In the control group, ISDN was given orally at the low dosage of 5 mg every 4 hours for 21 days. An uneventful course was seen in 28 BEP patients versus 15 in the control group (p&lt;0.05). Mortality and recurrence of angina were lower in the BEP group than in the control group, but the difference is not significant. On the other hand, moderate and severe hemodynamic complications did not occur in 80 BEP patients versus 65 in the control group (p&lt;0.05). Ventricular arrhythmias occurred in 36 BEP patients versus 50 in the control group (p&lt;0.05). Antiarrhythmic therapy was required in 14 BEP patients versus 61 in the control group (p&lt;0.001). These results show that bepridil seems capable of improving the hemodynamics and arrhythmologic course of AMI.", "label": "Yes.", "source": "6cross_chem", "answer": "yes"}
{"title": "Swimming against the Stream? A Discussion of the Bonding in d6 and d8 Fluoro Complexes and Its Consequences for Catalytic Applications", "abstract": "Fluoride has recently found increasing application as coligand both in complexes of late transition metals and as a reagent in asymmetric catalysis. In recent papers, this topic was reviewed, with emphasis on the role played by so-called \u2018push-pull interactions' between the fluoro ligand and a \u03c0 acid in the stabilization of fluoro complexes with a d6 or d8 electron configuration. This picture has led to the concept that fluoride is the strongest \u03c0-donor in the halide series. Herein, the latter concept is discussed and criticized. In particular, the effect of the ionicity of the metal-fluoride bond is proposed as an alternative explanation to most of the observations that show a \u2018reversed' halide order. The ionic character of the MF bond also accounts for its intrinsic reactivity and suggests some strategies for the stabilizatioin of fluoro complexes, including the use of coordinative unsaturation. The scope and limitations of the application of d6 and d8 fluoro complexes in catalysis are also discussed. The most promising application is the use of 16-electron fluoro complexes in the metal-promoted formation of the CF bond.", "DOI": "10.1002/1522-2675(200209)85:9<2686::aid-hlca2686>3.0.co;2-b", "len_ids": "006-987-460-560-735", "time": [2018, 5, 12], "source": "question/lens", "label": "Yes.", "answer": "yes"}
{"title": "Can Adversarial Weight Perturbations Inject Neural Backdoors?", "abstract": "Adversarial machine learning has exposed several security hazards of neural models and has become an important research topic in recent times. Thus far, the concept of an \"adversarial perturbation\" has exclusively been used with reference to the input space referring to a small, imperceptible change which can cause a ML model to err. In this work we extend the idea of \"adversarial perturbations\" to the space of model weights, specifically to inject backdoors in trained DNNs, which exposes a security risk of using publicly available trained models. Here, injecting a backdoor refers to obtaining a desired outcome from the model when a trigger pattern is added to the input, while retaining the original model predictions on a non-triggered input. From the perspective of an adversary, we characterize these adversarial perturbations to be constrained within an $\\ell_{\\infty}$ norm around the original model weights. We introduce adversarial perturbations in the model weights using a composite loss on the predictions of the original model and the desired trigger through projected gradient descent. We empirically show that these adversarial weight perturbations exist universally across several computer vision and natural language processing tasks. Our results show that backdoors can be successfully injected with a very small average relative change in model weight values for several applications.", "DOI": "10.1145/3340531.3412130", "source": "arxiv", "time": [2020, 9, 22], "label": "Yes.", "answer": "yes"}

{"title": "Do stellar winds play a decisive role in feeding AGN?", "abstract": "While the existence of a starburst-AGN connection is undisputed, there is no consensus on what the connection is. In this contribution, we begin by noting that the mechanisms which drive gas inwards in disk galaxies are generally inefficient at removing angular momentum, leading to stalled inflows. Thus, a tiered series of such processes is required to bring gas to the smallest scales, each of which on its own may not correlate with the presence of an AGN. Similarly, each may be associated with a starburst event, making it important to discriminate between 'circumnuclear' and 'nuclear' star formation. In this contribution, we show that stellar feedback on scales of tens of parsecs plays a critical role in first hindering and then helping accretion. We argue that it is only after the initial turbulent phases of a starburst that gas from slow stellar winds can accrete efficiently to smaller scales. This would imply that the properties of the obscuring torus are directly coupled to star formation and that the torus must be a complex dynamical entity. We finish by remarking on other contexts where similar processes appear to be at work.", "DOI": "10.1088/1742-6596/372/1/012046", "source": "arxiv", "time": [2015, 6, 3], "label": "yes", "answer": "no"}

Cycloaddition of Heptafulvalene with Tetracyanoethylene.", "abstract": "The cycloaddition of heptafulvalene (1) with tetracyanoethylene (TCNE) was previously described as an example of an antarafacial cycloaddition, a [\u03c014 a +\u03c02 s ] process that afforded only the trans cycloadduct by virtue of the edge-to-face approach of TCNE, facilitated by the S shape of 1. The reaction has been investigated in depth and found not to be a concerted antarafacial process. At low temperature, the reaction is observed to give a mixture of cis and trans cycloadducts as well as a [4+2] cycloadduct. The mixture of products is converted to the trans cycloadduct by equilibration upon warming to room temperature. Studies with diethyl 2,3-dicyanofumarate and -maleate confirmed the formation of cis cycloadducts. DFT studies at the M06-2X/6-311+G(2d,p) SCRF=acetone level of theory show that the originally proposed edge-to-face approach of TCNE to 1 is highly disfavored, whereas a stepwise mechanism involving the addition of TCNE at C2 to form a zwitterion followed by collapse at either C2' or C7' is energetically accessible. The Diels-Alder adduct is also formed in a stepwise reaction by competitive addition of TCNE at C4 of 1.

It may affect quality of life, require supportive care and impact treatment planning and its efficacy. Low-level laser therapy (LLLT) seems to promote pain relief and reduces OM incidence and its severity. It has been recommended for these patients as a treatment option but without any consensus in the LLLT procedure. New recommendations and perspectives for clinical trials will be discussed. Materials (Subjects) and Methods: Step by step, the efficacy of soft laser in the management of iatrogenic oral mucositis has been evaluated during the last two decades. Its effectiveness and level of recommendation got stronger with time. We will report and discuss some major results and the latest recommendations published on this topic. Results The major clinical results have been reported and analysed last year in a first meta-analysis (1)). 11 randomized placebo-controlled trials were selected with a total of 415 patients treated with chemotherapy and/or radiotherapy for head and neck cancer. The relative risk for developing OM was significantly reduced after LLLT but only for a dose between 1 to 6 Joules per point. Pain, severity and duration of OM grade \u2265 2 were also reduced without difference with placebo for possible side-effects. Nine years after the positive results published for patients treated by radiotherapy alone (2)), a new French randomized, multicentric, phase III trial for patients treated with new standard treatment, using LLLT in accordance to recent recommendations is ongoing. Seven centers are specifically established for this trial which should include a hundred patients.

{"title": "Can we utilize the higher Frenkel exciton state in biazulene diimides-based non-fullerene acceptors to promote charge separation at the donor/acceptor interface?", "abstract": "A hot exciton model is a widely accepted mechanism for the generation of photocurrent in organic bulk-heterojunction solar cells, in which the charge is transferred from the high-energy Frenkel exciton state (FE state) of the donor to the low-energy charge transfer states (CT states) and then is further separated into free charges. However, the FE state energy of the acceptor (FEA state) is usually lower than the values of CT states, which could hinder the pathway of efficient charge transfer from the FEA state to CT states. In order to take full advantage of this pathway, in this study, acceptor molecule 1 which breaks the Kasha's rule was selected to constitute the donor/acceptor (D/A) interface with donor molecule PTB7-Th. The density functional theory (DFT) and the time-dependent density functional theory (TD-DFT) calculations focusing on the charge transfer mechanism were carried out to verify our supposition. The results indeed show higher energy in the FEA state than the lowest CT states and enhanced charge transfer contribution (about 90%), which implies the realization of this additional pathway. Meanwhile, based on acceptor molecule 1, molecules 2\u20136 were designed by introducing different functional groups with the aim of enhancing the open circuit voltage (VOC) and photo-absorption ability while maintaining the advantage of the higher FE state energy, which demonstrates the improvement in hole and electron generation efficiency to some extent. Therefore, this study may provide a good strategy for designing new non-fullerene acceptors for organic solar cells (OSCs).", "DOI": "10.1039/d0nj01245a", "len_ids": "004-106-351-606-647", "time": [2020, 5, 19], "source": "question/lens", "label": "Yes.", "answer": "yes"}

Combining with optical observations in the literature, we showed that the blueshifted jet has lower density and higher excitation than the redshifted counterjet.

With DFFormH in CH3 CN, [{Yb(DFForm)2 (CH3 CN)}2 ] (Yb1) was obtained in good yield, and [Yb(DFForm)2 (thf)3 ] (Yb3) was obtained from a synthesis in CH3 CN/THF. Thus, this synthetic method completely circumvents the use of either salt metathesis, or redox transmetallation/protolysis (RTP) protocols to prepare divalent rare-earth formamidinates. Heating Yb1 in PhMe/C6 D6 resulted in decomposition to trivalent products, including one from a CH3 CN activation process. For a synthetic comparison, divalent ytterbium DFForm and DippForm complexes were synthesised by RTP reactions between Yb(0) , Hg(R)2 (R=Ph, C6 F5 ), and ArFormH in THF, leading to the isolation of either [Yb(DFForm)2 (thf)3 ] (Yb3), or the first five coordinate rare-earth formamidinate complex [Yb(DippForm)2 (thf)] (Yb4\u2009b), and, from adjustment of the stoichiometry, trivalent [Yb(DFForm)3 (thf)] (Yb6). Oxidation of Yb3 with benzophenone (bp), or halogenating agents (TiCl4 (thf)2 , Ph3 CCl, C2 Cl6 ) gave [Yb(DFForm)3 (bp)] or [Yb(DFForm)2 Cl(thf)2 ], respectively. Furthermore, the structural chemistry of divalent ArForm complexes has been substantially broadened. Not only have the highest and lowest coordination numbers for divalent rare-earth ArForm complexes been achieved in Eu2 and Yb4\u2009b, respectively, but also dimeric Eu1 and Yb1 have highly unusual ArForm bridging coordination modes, either perpendicular \u03bc-1\u03ba(N:N'):2\u03ba(N:N') in Eu1, or the twisted \u03bc-1\u03ba(N:N'):2\u03ba(N':F') DFForm coordination in Yb1, both unprecedented in divalent rare-earth ArForm chemistry and in the wider divalent rare-earth amidinate field.", "DOI": "10.1002/chem.201502953", "len_ids": "019-957-082-335-139", "time": [2018, 5, 12], "source": "question/lens", "label": "Yes.", "answer": "yes"}

We developed a simulation model describing a hypothetical population of consumers, assuming various types of correlation between two foods. Using this simulation model we found that the impact of the correlations in many cases is limited, but in particular circumstances it can be substantial, depending on the properties of the marginal distributions. Further, we found that the usual approach of first aggregating the observed intakes over foods, and then applying the statistical exposure models to the total daily intakes may lead to deviating results, even when all correlations are assumed to be zero. The approach of analyzing the intakes from the separate foods, and then aggregating the results from the statistical model applied to each food performed much better.

Quantum calculations of model systems suggest this not to be necessary. The placement of electron-withdrawing substituents on the base can reverse the sign of the potential in its lone pair or \u03c0-bond region to positive, and this base can nonetheless engage in a XB with the positive \u03c3-hole of a Lewis acid. The reverse scenario is also possible in certain circumstances, as a negatively charged \u03c3-hole can form a XB with the negative lone pair region of a base. Despite these classical Coulombic repulsions, the overall electrostatic interaction is attractive in these XBs, albeit only weakly so. The strengths of these bonds are surprisingly insensitive to changes in the partner molecule.

Pond size showed only a feeble relationship with the species richness of all other groups, particularly the Coleoptera and Amphibia. The weakness of this relationship was also indicated by the low z-values obtained (< 0.13). The SLOSS analyses showed that a set of ponds of small size has more species and has a higher conservation value than a single large pond of the same total area.

We observe polarized scattered light down to 0.16\" (~19 au) and find an inner gap with a significantly reduced scattered light flux. We confirm the previously detected double ring structure peaking at 0.18\" (~21 au) and 0.56\" (~66 au), and marginally detect a faint third gap at 0.70\"-0.73\" (~82-85 au). We explore dust evolution models in a disk perturbed by two giant planets, as well as models with a parameterized dust size distribution. The dust evolution model is able to reproduce the ring locations and gap widths in polarized intensity, but fails to reproduce their depths. It, however, gives a good match with the ALMA dust continuum image at 1.3 mm. Models with a parameterized dust size distribution better reproduce the gap depth in scattered light, suggesting that dust filtration at the outer edges of the gaps is less effective. The pile-up of millimeter grains in a dust trap and the continuous distribution of small grains throughout the gap likely require a more efficient dust fragmentation and dust diffusion in the dust trap. Alternatively, turbulence or charging effects might lead to a reservoir of small grains at the surface layer that is not affected by the dust growth and fragmentation cycle dominating the dense disk midplane.

Its role in the metabolism of L-xylulose has been known since 1970, when essential pentosuria was found to be associated with DCXR deficiency. Despite its early discovery, our knowledge about the role of human DCXR in normal physiology and pathophysiology is still incomplete. Sporadic studies have demonstrated aberrant expression in several cancers, but their physiological significance is unknown. In reproductive medicine, where DCXR is commonly referred to as 'sperm surface protein P34H', it serves as marker for epididymal sperm maturation and is essential for gamete interaction and successful fertilization. DCXR exhibits a multifunctional nature, both acting as a carbonyl reductase and also performing non-catalytic functions, possibly resulting from interactions with other proteins. Recent observations associate DCXR with a role in cell adhesion, pointing to a novel function involving tumour progression and possibly metastasis. This review summarizes the current knowledge about human DCXR and its orthologs from mouse and Caenorhabditis elegans (DHS-21) with an emphasis on its multifunctional characteristics.

Here we investigate the potential for GGI to deliver a set of complementary ES, driven by plant composition.We surveyed 36 landscapes across three European countries comprising core grasslands and their surrounding GGI. We calculated community-level values of plant species characteristics to provide indicators for four ES: nature conservation value, pollination, carbon storage and aesthetic appeal.Inferred ES delivery for GGI was substantially lower than in core grasslands for conservation, pollination and aesthetic appeal indicators, but not for carbon storage. These differences were driven by the GGI having 17% fewer plant species, and compositional differences, with 61% of species unique to the core grasslands. In addition, connectivity to the core, the amount of GGI and inferred seed dispersal distances by livestock, were strongly positively correlated with conservation value, pollination and aesthetic indicators. All ES indicators showed similar responses to the GGI spatial structure and distance to the core, suggesting robust effects of these drivers on ES. We projected that improved landscape-wide delivery of nature conservation value and pollination could be achieved through targeted GGI management. Reductions in the distances seeds would need to disperse, more GGI, along with a diversification of the GGI elements, were predicted to enhance service credits.We conclude that for vegetation-related ES, species surveys can be employed to assess potential ES delivery.

This study reports on the thermal degradation of modafinil, modafinic acid, adrafinil, CRL-40,940, and CRL-40,941 due to exposure to the heated GC injection port dissolved in a variety of solvents. Key degradation products common to modafinil, modafinic acid, and adrafinil analysis included diphenylmethanol and 1,1,2,2-tetraphenylethane (TPE), the latter of which was verified by its synthesis and characterization by x-ray crystallography. The investigated compounds were also characterized by 1 H and 13 C NMR. Diphenylmethane and thiobenzophenone were also identified in some instances. TPE formation was suggested to involve the generation of a benzhydrylium ion and its reaction with the sulfoxide oxygen of the parent compound to give an oxysulfonium intermediate. Correspondingly, the fluorinated TPE analogue was formed during heat-induced degradation of modafiendz, CRL-40,940 and CRL-40,941, respectively. When a mixture of modafinil (non-fluorinated) and modafiendz (fluorinated) were subjected to GC analysis, 4,4'-(2,2-diphenylethane-1,1-diyl)bis(fluorobenzene) was detected as a third cross reaction product in addition to the two expected TPE analogues. These observations served as a reminder that the seemingly straightforward implementation of GC-MS analysis can lead to challenges during routine analysis.", "DOI": "10.1002/dta.2142", "len_ids": "031-996-232-612-477", "time": [2018, 5, 12], "source": "question/lens", "label": "Yes.", "answer": "yes"}

Differential expression of miRNA, mRNA and proteins showed high conformity with literature and confirmed involvement in pregnancy establishment, embryo quality, steroid synthesis and prostaglandin regulation, but the link between differential miRNAs and their targets was limited and did not indicate the identity of an unequivocal signal for MRP in the horse. Differential expression at the embryo-maternal interface was prominent, highlighting a potential role of miRNAs in embryo-maternal communication during early pregnancy in the horse.

As a result of their wide-ranging actions, synthetic GCs are widely prescribed for numerous human and veterinary therapeutic purposes and consequently have been detected extensively within the aquatic environment. Synthetic GCs designed for humans are pharmacologically active in non-mammalian vertebrates, including fish, however they are generally detected in surface waters at low (ng/L) concentrations. In this review, we assess the potential environmental risk of synthetic GCs to fish by comparing available experimental data and effect levels in fish with those in mammals. We found the majority of compounds were predicted to have insignificant risk to fish, however some compounds were predicted to be of moderate and high risk to fish, although the dataset of compounds used for this analysis was small. Given the common mode of action and high level of inter-species target conservation exhibited amongst the GCs, we also give due consideration to the potential for mixture effects, which may be particularly significant when considering the potential for environmental impact from this class of pharmaceuticals. Finally, we also provide recommendations for further research to more fully understand the potential environmental impact of this relatively understudied group of commonly prescribed human and veterinary drugs.", "source": "material/elsevier_final", "label": "yes.", "answer": "yes"}

{"title": "The bleomycin animal model: a useful tool to investigate treatment options for idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis?", "abstract": "Different animal models of pulmonary fibrosis have been developed to investigate potential therapies for idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF). The most common is the bleomycin model in rodents (mouse, rat and hamster). Over the years, numerous agents have been shown to inhibit fibrosis in this model. However, to date none of these compounds are used in the clinical management of IPF and none has shown a comparable antifibrotic effect in humans. We performed a systematic review of publications on drug efficacy studies in the bleomycin model to evaluate the value of this model regarding transferability to clinical use. Between 1980 and 2006 we identified 246 experimental studies describing beneficial antifibrotic compounds in the bleomycin model. In 221 of the studies we found enough details about the timing of drug application to allow inter-study comparison. 211 of those used a preventive regimen , only 10 were therapeutic trials . It is critical to distinguish between drugs interfering with the inflammatory and early fibrogenic response from those preventing progression of fibrosis, the latter likely much more meaningful for clinical application. All potential antifibrotic compounds should be evaluated in the phase of established fibrosis rather than in the early period of bleomycin-induced inflammation for assessment of its antifibrotic properties. Further care should be taken in extrapolation of drugs successfully tested in the bleomycin model due to partial reversibility of bleomycin induced fibrosis over time.

{"title": "Inter-anion chalcogen bonds: Are they anti-electrostatic in nature?", "abstract": "Inter-anion hydrogen and halogen bonds have emerged as counterintuitive linkers and inspired us to expand the range of this unconventional bonding pattern. Here the inter-anion chalcogen bond (IAChB) was proposed and theoretically analyzed in a series of complexes formed by negatively charged bidentate chalcogen bond donors with chloride anion. The kinetic stability of IAChB was evidenced by the minima on binding energy profiles and further supported by ab initio molecular dynamic simulations. The block-localized wave function (BLW) method and its subsequent energy decomposition approach (BLW-ED) were employed to elucidate the physical origin of IAChB. While all other energy components vary monotonically as anions get together, the electrostatic interaction behaves exceptionally as it experiences a Coulombic repulsion barrier. Before reaching the barrier, the electrostatic repulsion increases with the shortening Ch\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7Cl- distance as expected from classical electrostatics. But after passing the barrier, the electrostatic repulsion decreases with the Ch\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7Cl- distance shortening and subsequently turns into the most favorable trend among all energy terms at short ranges, representing a dominating force for the kinetic stability of inter-anions. For comparison, all energy components exhibit the same trends and vary monotonically in the conventional counterparts where donors are neutral. By comparing inter-anions and their conventional counterparts, we found that only the electrostatic energy term is affected by the extra negative charge. Remarkably, the distinctive (nonmonotonic) electrostatic energy profiles were reproduced using QM-based atomic multipoles, suggesting that the crucial electrostatic interaction in IAChB can be rationalized within the classical electrostatic theory just like conventional non-covalent interactions.", "DOI": "10.1063/5.0076872", "len_ids": "003-411-456-457-611", "time": [2021, 12, 8], "source": "question/lens", "label": "Yes.", "answer": "no"}

The results of the PCA and FA show that altmetrics operate along different dimensions, whereas Mendeley counts are related to citation counts, and tweets form a separate dimension.

The importance of providing modern energy to rural areas cannot, therefore, be overemphasised. Despite numerous efforts by Governments and donors in the region to promote solar photovoltaics (PVs) for rural electrification , access to modern energy in rural Africa continues to be woefully low. In addition to being unaffordable to the rural masses, solar PV has the limitation that it can only be used for lighting and powering low-voltage appliances. This article reviews emerging trends in the rural energy sector of sub-Saharan Africa, and discusses the limitations of over-reliance on solar PV. It suggests possible options that could have greater impact on rural clean energy development. For the majority of rural households in the region, biomass fuels will continue to be the dominant fuel of choice. Efficient technologies for the use of biomass would, therefore, ensure that scarce biomass resources are effectively utilised, and reduce the negative impacts of biomass use on women and children's health. Solar thermal, windpumps, micro-/pico-hydropower and cleaner fuels such as kerosene and LPG, have not received adequate attention from policy makers.

In this article, we report a very simple approach for the decontamination of masks for multiple reuse during the COVID-19 pandemic. Used masks were soaked in hot water at a temperature greater than 56 \u00b0C for 30 min, based on a recommended method to kill COVID-19 virus by the National Health Commission of the People\u2019s Republic of China.

{"title": "Can a combination of vaccination and face mask wearing contain the COVID-19 pandemic?", "abstract": "The COVID-19 pandemic is going into its third year with Europe again being the focus of major epidemic activity. The present review tries to answer the question whether one can come to grip with the pandemic by a combination of vaccinations and non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs). Several COVID-19 vaccines are of remarkable efficacy and achieve high protection rates against symptomatic disease, especially severe disease, but mathematical models suggest that the current vaccination coverage in many countries is insufficient to achieve pandemic control. NPIs are needed as complementary measures because recent research has also revealed the limits of vaccination alone. Here, we review the evidence for efficacy of face mask wearing in various settings. Overall pooled analysis showed significant reduction in COVID-19 incidence with mask wearing, although heterogeneity between studies was substantial. Controlled trials of mask wearing are difficult to conduct, separating mask wearing effects in population studies from the impact of other NPIs is challenging and the efficacy of masks depend on mask material and mask fit. The combination of vaccination and mask wearing is potentially synergistic since vaccination protects so far well from disease development but immunity from infection wanes over few months after vaccination. In comparison, masks interfere with the virus transmission process at a level of a physical barrier independent of coronavirus variant. Vaccination and masks are much less costly to apply than other NPI measures which are associated with high economic and social costs, but paradoxically both measures are the target of a vocal opposition by a sizable minority of the society. In parallel with biomedical research, we need more social science research into this opposition to guide political decisions on how to end the pandemic.", "DOI": "10.1111/1751-7915.13997", "len_ids": "082-555-859-820-890", "time": [2022, 1, 3], "source": "7question/lens", "label": "Yes.", "answer": "yes"}
{"title": "Syndromic Surveillance for Local Outbreaks of Lower-Respiratory Infections: Would It Work?", "abstract": "Background: Although syndromic surveillance is increasingly used to detect unusual illness, there is a debate whether it is useful for detecting local outbreaks. We evaluated whether syndromic surveillance detects local outbreaks of lower-respiratory infections (LRIs) without swamping true signals by false alarms. Methods and Findings: Using retrospective hospitalization data, we simulated prospective surveillance for LRI-elevations. Between 1999\u20132006, a total of 290762 LRIs were included by date of hospitalization and patients place of residence (>80% coverage, 16 million population). Two large outbreaks of Legionnaires disease in the Netherlands were used as positive controls to test whether these outbreaks could have been detected as local LRI elevations. We used a space-time permutation scan statistic to detect LRI clusters. We evaluated how many LRI-clusters were detected in 1999\u20132006 and assessed likely causes for the cluster-signals by looking for significantly higher proportions of specific hospital discharge diagnoses (e.g. Legionnaires disease) and overlap with regional influenza elevations. We also evaluated whether the number of space-time signals can be reduced by restricting the scan statistic in space or time. In 1999\u20132006 the scan-statistic detected 35 local LRI clusters, representing on average 5 clusters per year. The known Legionnaires' disease outbreaks in 1999 and 2006 were detected as LRI-clusters, since cluster-signals were generated with an increased proportion of Legionnaires disease patients (p:<0.0001). 21 other clusters coincided with local influenza and/or respiratory syncytial virus activity, and 1 cluster appeared to be a data artifact. For 11 clusters no likely cause was defined, some possibly representing as yet undetected LRI-outbreaks. With restrictions on time and spatial windows the scan statistic still detected the Legionnaires' disease outbreaks, without loss of timeliness and with less signals generated in time (up to 42% decline).

We present here an original set of data covering twenty years of truck tests of 114 heavy-duty vehicles from 1999 to 2018. We compared fuel intensity (L/100\u202fkm) assessed under standard conditions (performance tests) with actual consumption recorded on road tests, concluding that journeying fuel intensity improved much less in normal driving conditions than in performance tests. We regressed journeying fuel intensity on a range of relevant variables, using a diverse set of models to cover different ways of relating data variables to each other. We found that average speed, though it increased, was not a significant factor in determining journeying fuel consumption. Instead, changes in rated power, maximum weight, absorbed power and first order efficiency were significant variables, and rebound effects associated with increased vehicle power were consistently evident and ranged from 6.130% to 20.21%, depending on the statistical model employed.", "DOI": "10.1016/j.energy.2021.120867", "len_ids": "009-090-421-589-36X", "time": [2021, 5, 26], "source": "question/lens", "label": "Yes.", "answer": "yes"}

The implementation at policy level remains with Member States where national policies are still overwhelmingly centralised. This creates barriers to the decentralization and democratization of energy and, ultimately, to achieving a \u2018just transition\u2019. This article therefore proposes as a way forward to recognise such renewable energy communities as legal entities to be embedded within a separate socio-legal institution (of civil energy networks), to shape (a transition towards) a just new energy system. After explaining what form this new institutional environment and the communities within would take, this article analyses this proposition in the light of the twin aims of energy decentralization and democratization to see how such forms can help achieve energy justice. It is also explained why this can only work upon an institutionally normative alignment. Following an appreciation in the light of growing research of such forms in the Netherlands, the UK and further afield, there seems to be a strong case for the proposed model.

Two reaction mechanisms including the addition\u2013elimination and the hydrogen abstraction reaction mechanisms are considered. In the addition\u2013elimination reactions, the halogen atoms approach C2H2, perpendicular to the CC triple bond, forming the pre-reactive complex C1 at the reaction entrance. C1 transforms to intermediate isomer I1 via transition state TSC1/1 with a negative/small barrier for C2H2F/C2H2Cl system, which can proceed by further eliminating H atom endothermally. While the hydrogen abstraction reactions also involve C1 for the fluorine atom abstraction of hydrogen, yet the hydrogen abstraction by chlorine atom first forms a collinear hydrogen-bonded complex C2. The other reaction pathways on the doublet PES are less competitive due to thermodynamical or kinetic factors. According to our results, the presence of pre-reactive complexes indicates that the simple hydrogen abstraction and addition in the halogen atoms reaction with unsaturated hydrocarbon should be more complex.

To explore this possibility, this paper draws on an increasing wealth of empirical data to analyze trends in three of the most important PPA price drivers: upfront installed project prices, operations, and maintenance (O&M) costs, and capacity factors. Average installed prices among a sample of utility-scale PV projects declined by more than one third (from $5.8/WAC to $3.7/WAC) from the 2007\u20132009 period through 2013, even as costlier systems with crystalline-silicon modules, sun tracking, and higher inverter loading ratios (ILRs) have constituted an increasing proportion of total utility-scale PV capacity . Actual and projected O&M costs from a very small sample of projects appear to range from $20\u2013$40/kWAC-year. The average net capacity factor is 30% for projects installed in 2012, up from 24% for projects installed in 2010, owing to better solar resources, higher ILRs, and greater use of tracking among the more recent projects. Based on these trends, a pro-forma financial model suggests that $50/MWh utility-scale PV is achievable using a combination of aggressive-but-achievable technical and financial input parameters . Although the US utility-scale PV market is still young, the rapid progress in the key metrics documented in this paper has made PV a viable competitor against other utility-scale renewable generators, and even conventional peaking generators, in certain regions of the country.

{"title": "Can High-velocity Protostellar Jets Help to Drive Low-velocity Outflow?", "abstract": "Using three-dimensional magnetohydrodynamics simulations, the driving of protostellar jets is investigated in different star-forming cores with the parameters of magnetic field strength and mass accretion rate. Powerful high-velocity jets appear in strongly magnetized clouds when the mass accretion rate onto the protostellar system is lower than $\\dot{M} \\lesssim 10^{-3}\\,{\\rm M}_\\odot$ yr$^{-1}$. On the other hand, even at this mass accretion rate range, no jets appear for magnetic fields of prestellar clouds as weak as $\\mu_0 \\gtrsim 5$--$10$, where $\\mu_0$ is the mass-to-flux ratio normalized by the critical value $(2\\pi G^{1/2})^{-1}$. For $\\dot{M}\\gtrsim 10^{-3}\\,{\\rm M}_\\odot$ yr$^{-1}$, although jets usually appear just after protostar formation independent of the magnetic field strength, they soon weaken and finally disappear. Thus, they cannot help drive the low-velocity outflow when there is no low-velocity flow just before protostar formation. As a result, no significant mass ejection occurs during the early mass accretion phase either when the prestellar cloud is weaky magnetized or when the mass accretion rate is very high. Thus, protostars formed in such environments would trace different evolutionary paths from the normal star formation process.", "DOI": "10.1093/mnras/stab2626", "source": "arxiv", "time": [2021, 9, 22], "label": "Yes.", "answer": "no"}

{"title": "Laminin-332-integrin interaction: a target for cancer therapy?", "abstract": "For many years, extracellular matrix (ECM) was considered to function as a tissue support and filler. However, we now know that ECM proteins control many cellular events through their interaction with cell-surface receptors and cytoplasmic signaling pathways. For example, they regulate cell proliferation, cell division, cell adhesion, cell migration, and apoptosis. We focus in this review on a laminin isoform, laminin-332 (formerly termed laminin-5), a major component of the basement membrane (BM) of skin and other epithelial tissues. It is composed of 3 subunits (\u03b13, \u03b23, and \u03b32) and interacts with at least two integrin receptors expressed by epithelial cells (\u03b13\u03b21 and \u03b16\u03b24 integrin). Mutations in either laminin-332 or integrin \u03b16\u03b24 result in junctional epidermolysis bullosa, a blistering skin disease, while targeting of laminin-332 by autoantibodies in cicatricial pemphigoid leads to dysadhesion of epithelial cells from their underlying connective tissue. Abnormal expression of laminin-332 and its integrin receptors is also a hallmark of certain tumor types and is believed to promote invasion of colon, breast and skin cancer cells. Moreover, there is emerging evidence that laminin-332 and its protease degradation products are not only found at the leading front of several tumors but also likely induce and/or promote tumor cell migration. Thus, in this review, we focus specifically on the role of laminin-332 and its integrin receptors in adhesion, proliferation, and migration/invasion of cancer cells. Finally, we discuss strategies for the development of laminin-332-based antagonists for the treatment of malignant tumors.", "DOI": "10.2174/092986708785132834", "len_ids": "167-315-136-867-918", "time": [2018, 5, 11], "source": "question/lens", "label": "Yes.", "answer": "yes"}
{"title": "Polyphenol oxidase in leaves: is there any significance to the chloroplastic localization?", "abstract": "Polyphenol oxidase (PPO) catalyses the oxidation of monophenols and/or o-diphenols to o-quinones with the concomitant reduction of oxygen to water which results in protein complexing and the formation of brown melanin pigments. The most frequently suggested role for PPO in plants has been in defence against herbivores and pathogens, based on the physical separation of the chloroplast-localized enzyme from the vacuole-localized substrates. The o-quinone-protein complexes, formed as a consequence of cell damage, may reduce the nutritional value of the tissue and thereby reduce predation but can also participate in the formation of structural barriers against invading pathogens. However, since a sufficient level of compartmentation-based regulation could be accomplished if PPO was targeted to the cytosol, the benefit derived by some plant species in having PPO present in the chloroplast lumen remains an intriguing question. So is there more to the chloroplastic location of PPO? An interaction between PPO activity and photosynthesis has been proposed on more than one occasion but, to date, evidence either for or against direct involvement has been equivocal, and the lack of identified chloroplastic substrates remains an issue. Similarly, PPO has been suggested to have both pro- and anti-oxidant functions. Nevertheless, several independent lines of evidence suggest that PPO responds to environmental conditions and could be involved in the response of plants to abiotic stress. This review highlights our current understanding of the in vivo functions of PPO and considers the potential opportunities it presents for exploitation to increase stress tolerance in food crops.", "DOI": "10.1093/jxb/erv141", "len_ids": "087-995-773-701-322", "time": [2018, 5, 12], "source": "1search_engine/lens", "label": "Yes.", "answer": "yes"}
{"title": "A Break in the Highest Energy Cosmic Ray Spectrum: A Signature of New Physics?", "abstract": "Recent experimental data from the Fly's Eye and the Akeno array seem to indicate significant structure in the ultrahigh energy cosmic ray spectrum above $10^{18}\\eV$. A statistically significant dip has been established at about $5\\times10^{18}\\eV$. In addition, each experiment observed a different superhigh energy event above $10^{20}\\eV$ separated from the rest of the data by about half a decade in energy. In this article we discuss what this implies for the existence or non-existence of the ``Greisen-Zatsepin-Kuz'min cutoff'', a long lasting and still open question in cosmic ray physics. This cutoff, caused by energy losses in the cosmic microwave background, is predicted to occur at a few times $10^{19}\\eV$ if cosmic rays are produced by shock acceleration of lower energy particles at extragalactic distances. We show that from the spectral point of view, sources nearer than a few $\\Mpc$ are still consistent with the data at the $1\\sigma$ level, provided these sources accelerate particles beyond $3\\times10^{20}\\eV$. However, persistence of the apparent gap in the existing data at the level of a 4 times higher total exposure would rule out a wide range of acceleration models at $98\\%$ C.L., whether they rely on nearby or extragalactic sources. This might hint to the existence of a ``top down'' mechanism which produces an additional hard component of ultrahigh energy particles directly, say, by decay from some higher energy scale in contrast to bottom up acceleration of charged particles. In this scenario a cutoff followed by a pronounced spectral flattening and possibly even a gap could naturally be formed.", "DOI": "10.1126/science.270.5244.1977", "source": "arxiv", "time": [2009, 10, 28], "label": "Yes.", "answer": "maybe"}

Res. 11, 785-797), suggesting that structural alterations in antithrombin may accompany its reaction with thrombin. The hydroxy-nitrobenzyl (HNB) group attached to a unique tryptophan has been used in the present study as an extrinsic probe for localization of conformational changes to the heparin-binding region within antithrombin III using immunochemical and spectral techniques. Site-specific modification of tryptophan-49 in antithrombin with the hydroxynitrobenzyl reagent blocks heparin binding to the protein and provides a chemical label in the heparin-binding region of the protein J. Biol. Chem. 259, 939-941). Antibodies specific for the hydroxynitrobenzyl hapten, which bind to HNB-tryptophan-49 in antithrombin, were used to detect a change in conformation in the region of tryptophan-49 which occurs upon thrombin binding to antithrombin. This thrombin-induced structural change was also apparent from spectral perturbations which were detected with the environmentally sensitive HNB moiety. Thus, the HNB group was used as an immunochemical probe as well as a spectral reporter group to provide insight into an allosteric mechanism of control in the catalytic role of heparin. The thrombin-promoted alteration of the structure in the heparin-binding region is presumably responsible for recycling of heparin, allowing it to catalyze further reactions between antithrombin and thrombin.", "DOI": "10.1016/s0021-9258(18)47601-6", "len_ids": "031-003-421-857-490", "time": [2018, 5, 8], "source": "1search_engine/lens", "label": "Yes.", "answer": "yes"}

Prog. Neuro-Psychopharmacol. & Biol. Psychiat. 1987, 11 : 419\u2013458 1. 1. Kety hypothesized that forebrain norepinephrine acted to selectively enhance cell firing in neurons receiving environmental inputs during affectively important events. He further suggested that norepinephrine could act to induce a \u2018persistent facilitation\u2019 of the inputs which accompany affectively important events and would thus promote a memory for these events. 2. 2. The electrophysiological actions of norepinephrine at the time Kety proposed his hypothesis were thought to be inhibitory. More recent evidence has demonstrated that norepinephrine in neocortex and cerebellum enhances both excitatory and inhibitory evoked activity much as Kety proposed. This has been termed norepinephrine neuromodulation. 3. 3. The locus coeruleus-norepinephrine system which gives rise to neocortical and cerebellar norepinephrine innervation also innervates, even more densely, areas of the limbic system. A review of norepinephrine actions, particularly in limbic cortex, indicates that locus coeruleus-norepinephrine also enhances transmission of evoked inputs in these structures. 4. 4. A long-lasting enhancement of evoked inputs by locus coeruleus-norepinephrine has been demonstrated in the hippocampus. This long-lasting enhancement of inputs is reviewed in detail since it appears to directly support Kety's hypothesized \u2018persistent facilitation\u2019 effect of norepinephrine.

Saliva samples were taken with the Salivette\u00ae device. Plasma and saliva concentrations of the enantiomers of propranolol were determined by HPLC with fluorescence detection. The transport of propranolol from plasma to the salivary gland appears to be not stereospecific and not saturable. Therefore, there is no indication that the transport of propranolol to the salivary gland is active. The concentrations of both enantiomers of propranolol in saliva, however, were higher than those of both enantiomers in venous plasma. In the past this phenomenon was interpreted as an indication of active transport, but it could be explained by the fact that salivary concentration more closely reflects the central compartment than that of peripheral venous blood.", "time": [2003, 5, 13], "DOI": "10.1016/0731-7085(95)01569-7", "label": "Yes.", "source": "6cross_chem", "answer": "no"}

This component can be fit with different models; in particular the addition of a spectral line provides the best representation.In this paper we investigate the physical properties that the surrounding medium must have in order to produce a spectral feature that can explain the detected emission. We analyse and discuss how and if the detected spectral excess fits in different theoretical models developed to explain the nature of line emission during the afterglow phase of Gamma-Ray Bursts (GRBs). Trasmission and reflection models have been considered. Given the high value (>>1) of the Thomson optical depth, the emission is likely to arise in a reflection scenario. Within reflection models, the external reflection geometry fails to predict the observed luminosity. On the contrary, the detected feature can be explained in a funnel scenario with typical opening angle theta of 5 degrees, Nickel mass of the order of 0.1 M_o and T=10^6 K. For theta=20 degrees, assuming the reprocessing material to be the SN shell, the detected emission implies a Nickel mass of 0.4 M_o at T=10^7 K and a metallicity 10 times the solar value.

{"title": "Nonperturbative approach to non-Condon effects: must a nonadiabatic transition always occur at the potential surface crossing?", "abstract": "We present a generating function method for the computation of nonCondon effects in the context of nonadiabatic multiphonon transition theory. The method is nonperturbative in the electron-phonon coupling and nonperturbative in the dependence of the transition matrix element on nuclear coordinates, but it does assume the overall transition rate is small enough to be treated perturbatively. We do not assume the transition operator is given by the Born-Oppenheimer breakdown operator but rather consider more general forms of the transition matrix element V(x), where x represents nuclear coordinates. In particular, for narrow forms of V(x) such as a delta function, the optimum position (that position of V(x) which produces the maximal transition rate) is temperature dependent and may not coincide with the transition state. This calls into question the classical notion that a transition occursvia a thermal fluctuation to the potential surface crossing. Theclassical significance of the transition state does appear valid, however, at low temperature and large electron-phonon coupling. Furthermore, when V(x) is broad and the non-Condon effects are weak, the transition rate can be expressed in the Condon approximation with suitably scaled parameters. Since this scaling is temperature dependent, there may be an apparent change in the reorganization energy and in the enthalpy and entropy of activation. When many vibrational modes couple to the transition, there are circumstances under which a single promoting mode can dominate the vibrational effects. In thecontext of optical lineshapes, this means there are circumstances under which a weakly coupled vibrational mode can cause the wings of a line to assume a strictly exponential, rather than Gaussian, shape.", "DOI": "10.1021/j100145a009", "len_ids": "188-441-788-393-243", "time": [2018, 5, 12], "source": "question/lens", "label": "Yes.", "answer": "no"}

{"title": "Detection of transient low-temperature combustion characteristics by ion current \u2013 The missing link for homogeneous charge compression ignition control?", "abstract": "Homogeneous charge compression ignition is a promising low-temperature combustion mode because of its high efficiency and low emissions; however, its strong cycle-to-cycle coupling effect, which caused by the recirculation of exhaust gases, may entail problems with low combustion stability. In this study, a new concept that extracts more comprehensive combustion information in homogeneous charge compression ignition is proposed through the integration of ion current and in-cylinder pressure sensing. To analyze the correlations of combustion parameters and their relationships with the ion current parameters, steady-state measurements were conducted. Dynamic measurements were implemented to form a comprehensive database for artificial neural network training. To investigate the hypothesis that the ion current gives additional information beyond the pressure trace, black-box models based on experimental data are trained. The results show that the baseline model trained purely with the manipulated variables has the worst performance, while the model including both in-cylinder pressure and ion current derived parameters has the best predictability, with the overall root-mean-square error reduced by 2.5% in predicting combustion phasing, compared with in-cylinder pressure based model. It demonstrates that a significant improvement in model quality can be achieved by the combination of ion current and in-cylinder pressure sensing, which indicates that the ion current signal contains information that goes beyond a sole analysis of the pressure trace. By complementing the in-cylinder pressure, the use of the ion current as a \u201cchemical sensor\u201d for low-temperature combustion thus appears very promising for the stable control of homogeneous charge compression ignition combustion.", "time": [2020, 12, 13], "DOI": "10.1016/j.apenergy.2020.116299", "source": "3cross_byjournal/elsevier", "label": "Yes.", "answer": "yes"}

{"title": "Is shifting from Li-ion NMC to LFP in EVs beneficial for second-life storages in electricity markets?", "abstract": "While electric vehicles are promising to reduce carbon emissions on the road, from a holistic life-cycle view, further environmental considerations in the production and end-of-life management of their batteries are required. Recently, circular end-of-life thinking has been promoted with strategies to increase retired batteries' lifetime through second-life as lifetime extension is typically favoured in life cycle assessment. However, standardization of these strategies toward recycling or repurposing paths is recommended for different Li-ion chemistries. This categorization mainly concerns the cobalt-containing cathode Li-ion batteries i.e., NMC which is the dominant technology for transportation, and the alternative technology i.e., LFPs with a more recent attention toward them in automobile sector due the cobalt scarcity in the supply chain. This technology shift will impact their end-of-life management at the retirement. In this arrangement, the economic priority of repurposing such battery chemistries needs quantification. This study evaluated the financial return of repurposing retired Li-ion NMC and LFP batteries for energy arbitrage applications in power systems. The feasibility of repurposing is examined in the Irish and Queensland's markets. Results show that retired Li-ion LFPs respond to price fluctuations more frequently with a higher financial return compared to NMCs; thus, they have higher potential for repurposing as such their greater integration in new vehicles is promising from a circular economy perspective. Different rates of return have been observed for various sizes of systems and battery durations. The financial benefits are more prominent for a one-hour battery in a medium system compared to half and two-hour durations and a smaller system. A sensitivity analysis shows that even spending the same capital cost as a new system for a repurposed system results in a marginal financial return in a competitive electricity market like Queensland's, whereas further incentives toward circular-enabling business models from local authorities will effectively make such investments feasible.", "time": [2023, 5, 22], "DOI": "10.1016/j.est.2023.107740", "label": "Yes.", "source": "6cross_chem", "answer": "yes"}

Another threat to global public health is the dissemination of antibiotic resistance (AR) in freshwater environmental reservoirs from anthropogenic sources, such as wastewater discharge and urban and agricultural runoff. In this study, cyanobacteria are now hypothesized to play a role in the environmental resistome. A non-systematic literature review of studies using molecular techniques was conducted to explore indirect and direct ways cyanobacteria might contribute to environmental AR. Results show cyanobacteria can host antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) and might promote the spread of ARGs in bacteria due to the significant contribution of mobile genetic elements (MGEs) located in genera such as Microcystis. However, cyanobacteria may promote or inhibit the spread of ARGs in environmental freshwater bacteria due to other factors as well. The purpose of this review is to 1) consider the role of cyanobacteria as AR hosts, since cyanoHABs are historically considered to be a separate problem from AR, and 2) to identify the knowledge gap in understanding cyanobacteria as ARG reservoirs. Cyanobacterial blooms, as well as other biotic and abiotic factors, should be studied further using advanced methods such as shotgun metagenomic and long read sequencing to clarify the extent of their functional ARGs/MGEs and influences on environmental AR.", "source": "material/elsevier_final", "label": "Yes.", "answer": "yes"}

The proton can be held through H-bonding interactions with the two carbonyl oxygen atoms in macrocycles containing rigid (phenyl) and flexible (propyl) bridges. The solute-solvent H-bonding interactions cause the macrocyclic backbones to twist to different extents, depending on the different bridges. The macrocycle with the rigid phenyl linkages folds into a cuplike shape due to \u03c0-\u03c0 interaction, while the propyl analogue still maintains the ellipsoidal ringlike shape with just a slight distortion. The potential energy required for proton transfer is larger in the phenyl-containing macrocycle than in the compound with propyl units. When an external electric field with a strength of 2.5 V nm(-1) is exerted along the carbonyl oxygen atoms, a difference in proton encircling is exhibited for macrocycles with rigid and flexible bridges. In contrast to encapsulation of a proton in the propyl analogue, the intermolecular solute-solvent H-bonding and intramolecular \u03c0-\u03c0 stacking between the two rigid phenyl spacers leads to loss of the proton from the highly distorted cuplike macrocycle with phenyl bridges. The competition between intra- and intermolecular interactions governs the behavior of proton encircling in macrocycles.", "DOI": "10.1002/cphc.201100229", "len_ids": "017-943-388-876-042", "time": [2018, 5, 12], "source": "question/lens", "label": "Yes.", "answer": "maybe"}
{"title": "Can magnetized turbulence set the mass scale of stars?", "abstract": "Understanding the evolution of self-gravitating, isothermal, magnetized gas is crucial for star formation, as these physical processes have been postulated to set the initial mass function (IMF). We present a suite of isothermal magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) simulations using the GIZMO code, that resolve the formation of individual stars in giant molecular clouds (GMCs), spanning a range of Mach numbers found in observed GMCs. As in past works, the mean and median stellar masses are sensitive to numerical resolution, because they are sensitive to low-mass stars that contribute a vanishing fraction of the overall stellar mass. The {\\em mass-weighted} median stellar mass $M_\\mathrm{50}$ becomes insensitive to resolution once turbulent fragmentation is well-resolved. Without imposing Larson-like scaling laws, our simulations find $M_\\mathrm{50} \\propto M_\\mathrm{0} \\mathcal{M}^{-3} \\alpha_\\mathrm{turb} \\mathrm{SFE}^{1/3}$ for GMC mass $M_\\mathrm{0}$, sonic Mach number $\\mathcal{M}$, virial parameter $\\alpha_\\mathrm{turb}$, and star formation efficiency $\\mathrm{SFE}=M_\\mathrm{\\star}/M_\\mathrm{0}$. This fit agrees well with previous IMF results from the RAMSES, ORION2, and SphNG codes. Although $M_\\mathrm{50}$ has no significant dependence on the magnetic field strength at the cloud scale, MHD is necessary to prevent a fragmentation cascade that results in non-convergent stellar masses. For initial conditions and SFE similar to star-forming GMCs in our Galaxy, we predict $M_\\mathrm{50}$ to be $>20 M_{\\odot}$, an order of magnitude larger than observed ($\\sim 2 M_\\odot$), together with an excess of brown dwarfs. Moreover, $M_\\mathrm{50}$ is sensitive to initial cloud properties and evolves strongly in time within a given cloud, predicting much larger IMF variations than are observationally allowed.

{"title": "Priority Water Rights for Irrigation at the River Basin Level. Do They Improve Economic Efficiency During Drought Periods?", "abstract": "This paper assesses the potential efficiency gains of reforming the water rights regime in the Spanish agricultural sector by replacing current allocation procedures based on the proportional rule with a priority allocation procedure based on two tiers of security-differentiated water rights. This assessment is useful for evaluating whether said change in water rights can be considered a suitable policy instrument to improve water management during droughts events. For this purpose, a mathematical programming model is built to simulate the performance of the proposed reform. The empirical analysis is implemented at the basin scale, where water rights holders are highly heterogeneous, considering different climate scenarios accounting for changes in water supply reliability. The Guadalquivir River Basin (GRB) in southern Spain is used as a case study. The results obtained show that this change in the water allocation regime would yield only modest economic efficiency gains under the current climate scenario. However, it is also evidenced that this policy instrument could play a more relevant role as an efficiency enhancer in a climate change scenario, given that more frequent and intense drought episodes are expected. Moreover, priority rights represent an interesting risk management instrument for farmers, allowing the most vulnerable farmers to reduce income volatility. These findings suggest that the combined implementation of the proposed shift in the allocation regime with spot or allocation water markets would lead to successful outcomes, significantly improving drought management in the irrigation sector.", "DOI": "10.1007/s11269-022-03228-8", "len_ids": "024-656-500-791-199", "time": [2022, 8, 29], "source": "question/lens", "label": "Yes.", "answer": "yes"}

Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common form of senile dementia, which is characterized by \u03b2 -amyloid (A \u03b2 ) deposition in specific brain regions. However, the molecular mechanism underlying AD pathology remains elusive. Dysfunctional Wnt signaling is associated with several diseases such as epilepsy, cancer, metabolic disease, and AD. Increasing evidence suggests that downregulation of Wnt signaling, induced by A \u03b2 , is associated with disease progression of AD. More importantly, persistent activation of Wnt signaling through Wnt ligands, or inhibition of negative regulators of Wnt signaling, such as Dickkopf-1 (DKK-1) and glycogen synthase kinase-3 \u03b2 (GSK-3 \u03b2 ) that are hyperactive in the disease state, is able to protect against A \u03b2 toxicity and ameliorate cognitive performance in AD. Together, these data suggest that Wnt signaling might be a potential therapeutic target of AD.

We demonstrate that while the parameters of intraday agent-based models rooted in market microstructure can be meaningfully calibrated, those exclusively related to agent behaviors and incentives remain problematic. This could simply be a failure of the calibration techniques used but we argue that the observed parameter degeneracies are most likely a consequence of the realistic matching processes employed in these models.

The signal-to-noise ratios of the resulting spectra are improved by a factor of up to 3.2 compared to those obtained with normal stacking analysis. We successfully detect a weak 13CO emission from the interarm region where the emission was not detected in the individual pointings. We compare the integrated intensity ratios I12 CO/I13 CO among six characteristic regions . We find that I12CO/I13CO in the bar and interarm are higher than those in the other regions by a factor of ~2 and I12CO/I13CO in the center is moderately high. These high I12CO/I13CO ratios in the bar and center are attributed to a high intensity ratio (T12CO/T13CO) and one in the interarm is attributed to a high ratio of the full width at half maximum of spectra (FWHM12CO/FWHM13CO). The difference between FWHM12CO and FWHM13CO of the interarm indicates the existence of two components, one with a narrow line width (~FWHM13CO) and the other with a broad line width (~FWHM12CO). Additionally, the T12CO/T13CO ratio in the broad-line-width component of the interarm is higher than the other regions. The high T12CO/T13CO in the center and bar and of the broad-line-width component in the interarm suggest the existence of non-optically thick 12CO components. We find that more than half of the 12CO emissions of the interarm are likely to be radiated from the diffuse component.

Many cases of myocarditis/Pericarditis after the mRNA COVID-19 vaccine have been reported to the VARES (Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System). Case Presentation: A 20-year-old male with a history of mild asthma, who previously received two Pfizer covid -19 vaccines, presented to the emergency department with a chief complaint of chest pain two days after receiving a third booster dose of the Moderna vaccine. Troponin and C- Reactive Protein was Elevated, ECG findings revealed acute pericarditis, and MRI showed myocarditis. Echocardiography was normal except for moderate hypokinesis of the septal and inferior left ventricular regional wall segments and trivial pericardial effusion. The patient was admitted for treatment with aspirin, colchicine, metoprolol, and famotidine. His condition was improved, and he was discharged with a follow-up plan.Discussion: So far, most of the cases of Myocarditis/Pericarditis associated with mRNA COVID-19 vaccine were after the second dose; however, not many cases were reported after the booster dose or switching the type of mRNA vaccine.

{"title": "One size fits all?: A simulation framework for face-mask fit on population-based faces.", "abstract": "The use of face masks by the general population during viral outbreaks such as the COVID-19 pandemic, although at times controversial, has been effective in slowing down the spread of the virus. The extent to which face masks mitigate the transmission is highly dependent on how well the mask fits each individual. The fit of simple cloth masks on the face, as well as the resulting perimeter leakage and face mask efficacy, are expected to be highly dependent on the type of mask and facial topology. However, this effect has, to date, not been adequately examined and quantified. Here, we propose a framework to study the efficacy of different mask designs based on a quasi-static mechanical model of the deployment of face masks onto a wide range of faces. To illustrate the capabilities of the proposed framework, we explore a simple rectangular cloth mask on a large virtual population of subjects generated from a 3D morphable face model. The effect of weight, age, gender, and height on the mask fit is studied. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommended homemade cloth mask design was used as a basis for comparison and was found not to be the most effective design for all subjects. We highlight the importance of designing masks accounting for the widely varying population of faces. Metrics based on aerodynamic principles were used to determine that thin, feminine, and young faces were shown to benefit from mask sizes smaller than that recommended by the CDC. Besides mask size, side-edge tuck-in, or pleating, of the masks as a design parameter was also studied and found to have the potential to cause a larger localized gap opening.", "DOI": "10.1371/journal.pone.0252143", "len_ids": "009-006-835-403-305", "time": [2021, 6, 21], "source": "7question/lens", "label": "Yes.", "answer": "no"}

TauD converts taurine into amino acetaldehyde and sulfite at its nonheme iron center, and a large H/D kinetic isotope effect (KIE) has been found in the hydrogen atom transfer (HAT) of taurine suggesting a large tunneling effect. Recently, highly electrophilic Fe\u00ad(III)-oxyl radicals have been proposed as a key species for HAT in the catalytic mechanism of C\u2013H activation, which might be prepared prior to the actual HAT. In order to investigate this hypothesis and large tunneling effect, DFT potential energy surfaces along the intrinsic reaction path were generated. The predicted rate constants and H/D KIEs using variational transition-state theory including multidimensional tunneling, based on these potential surfaces, have excellent agreement with experimental data. This study revealed that the reactive processes of C\u2013H activation consisted of two distinguishable parts: (1) the substrate approaching the Fe\u00ad(IV)-oxo center without C\u2013H bond cleavage, which triggers the catalytic process by inducing metal-to-ligand charge transfer to form the Fe\u00ad(III)-oxyl species, and (2) the actual HAT from the substrate to the Fe\u00ad(III)-oxyl species. Most of the activation energy was used in the first part, and the actual HAT required only a small amount of energy to overcome the TS with a very large tunneling effect.

A Search for Systematics in the Fermi-LAT Data", "abstract": "Our recent claims of a Galactic center feature in Fermi-LAT data at approximately 130 GeV have prompted an avalanche of papers proposing explanations ranging from dark matter annihilation to exotic pulsar winds. Because of the importance of such interpretations for physics and astrophysics, a discovery will require not only additional data, but a thorough investigation of possible LAT systematics. While we do not have access to the details of each event reconstruction, we do have information about each event from the public event lists and spacecraft parameter files. These data allow us to search for suspicious trends that could indicate a spurious signal. We consider several hypotheses that might make an instrumental artifact more apparent at the Galactic center, and find them implausible. We also search for an instrumental signature in the Earth limb photons, which provide a smooth reference spectrum for null tests. We find no significant 130 GeV feature in the Earth limb sample. However, we do find a marginally significant 130 GeV feature in Earth limb photons with a limited range of detector incidence angles. This raises concerns about the 130 GeV Galactic center feature, even though we can think of no plausible model of instrumental behavior that connects the two. A modest amount of additional limb data would tell us if the limb feature is a statistical fluke. If the limb feature persists, it would raise doubts about the Pass 7 processing of E > 100 GeV events.

Moreover, the behaviour of nitrogen data along the evolution confirms the existence of non-canonical extra-mixing on the RGB for all low-mass stars in the field.

After four initial protonation/reduction steps, the H4CFe8S9 cluster has two hydrogen atoms attached to sulfur, one hydrogen bridging two iron centers and one hydrogen bonded to carbon. The loss of the CH and FeHFe hydrogens as molecular hydrogen activates the cluster to addition of N2 to the carbon center. This unique step takes place at a nearly planar four-coordinate carbon center and leads to an intermediate with a significantly weakened N-N bond. A hydrogen attached to a sulfur atom is then transferred to the distal nitrogen atom. Additional prontonation/reduction steps are modeled by adding a hydrogen atom to sulfur and locating the transition states for transfer to nitrogen. The first NH3 is lost in a thermal neutral step, while the second step is endothermic. The loss of H2 activates the complex by reducing the barrier for N2 addition by 3.5 kcal/mol. Since this is the most difficult step in the mechanism, reducing the barrier for this step justifies the \"extra expense\" of H2 production.", "DOI": "10.1021/acs.jpca.5b10384", "len_ids": "007-851-062-051-621", "time": [2018, 5, 12], "source": "question/lens", "label": "Yes.", "answer": "yes"}

A combination of atomic force microscopy (AFM), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), Auger electron spectroscopy (AES) and time-of-flight secondary ion mass spectrometry (TOF-SIMS) was used to study the surface composition and morphology after oxidation. A distribution of large ( approximately 0.1-10 microm) organic aggregates was formed, while the surrounding substrate became depleted of carbon compared to the unreacted SAM. This highly unusual result establishes that the mechanism of ozonolysis of alkene SAMs must have a channel that is unique compared to that in the gas phase or in solution, and may involve polymerization induced by the Criegee intermediate (CI). Oxidation at 60% RH led to the formation of a number of smaller aggregates, suggesting water intercepted the CI in competition with aggregate formation. The uptake of water, measured using transmission FTIR, was not increased upon oxidation of these films. In conjunction with literature reports of polymer formation from VOC-NO(x) photooxidations, these results suggest that formation of aggregates and polymers in the atmosphere is much more widespread than previously thought.

This study assessed the extent to which N2O emission levels were determined by termite feeding guild and tested the hypothesis that termite species feeding on a diet rich in N emit higher levels of N2O than those feeding on a diet low in N. An in-vitro incubation approach was used to determine the levels of N2O production in 14 termite species belonging to different feeding guilds, collected from a wide range of biomes. Fungus-growing and soil-feeding termites emit N2O. The N2O production levels varied considerably, ranging from 13.14 to 117.62 ng N2O-N d-1 (g dry wt.)-1 for soil-feeding species, with Cubitermes spp. having the highest production levels, and from 39.61 to 65.61 ng N2O-N d-1 (g dry wt.)-1 for fungus-growing species. Wood-feeding termites were net N2O consumers rather than N2O producers with a consumption ranging from 16.09 to 45.22 ng N2O-N d-1 (g dry wt.)-1. Incubating live termites together with their mound increased the levels of N2O production by between 6 and 13 fold for soil-feeders, with the highest increase in Capritermes capricornis, and between 14 and 34 fold for fungus-growers, with the highest increase in Macrotermes muelleri. Ammonia-oxidizing (amoA-AOB and amoA-AOA) and denitrifying (nirK, nirS, nosZ) gene markers were detected in the guts of all termite species studied. No correlation was found between the abundance of these marker genes and the levels of N2O production from different feeding guilds.

Here we report a family of functional high-mannose oligosaccharide mimics that reproduce not only the terminal mannopyranosyl display, but also the core structure and the branching pattern, by replacing some inner mannopyranosyl units with triazole rings. Such molecular design can be implemented by exploiting \"click\" ligation strategies, resulting in a substantial reduction of synthetic cost. The binding affinities of the new \"click\" high-mannose oligosaccharide mimics towards two mannose specific lectins, namely the plant lectin concanavalin A (ConA) and the human macrophage mannose receptor (rhMMR), have been studied by enzyme-linked lectin assays and found to follow identical trends to those observed for the natural oligosaccharide counterparts. Calorimetric determinations against ConA, and X-ray structural data support the conclusion that these compounds are not just another family of multivalent mannosides, but real \"structural mimics\" of the high-mannose oligosaccharides.", "DOI": "10.1002/chem.201405481", "len_ids": "055-002-659-688-558", "time": [2018, 5, 12], "source": "question/lens", "label": "Yes.", "answer": "yes"}
{"title": "Does the Gln27Gln polymorphism of the adrenoreceptor beta 2 gene affect the clinical course of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease?", "abstract": "Introduction: Many recent guidelines have highlighted the importance of genetic factors in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) development. Adrenoreceptor beta 2 (ADRB2) is believed to be linked to the response to beta 2 agonists. However, the data for this gene remains controversial. In our study we aimed to investigate the impact of the Gln27Glu gene polymorphism of ADRB2 on the clinical course of COPD. Methods: 100 patients were included into the study. We assessed GOLD group, number of exacerbations, hospitalizations, modified Medical Research Council (mMRC) dyspnea and COPD assessment test (CAT) scores, and the utilization of antibiotics, glucocorticoids, and xanthines in these patients, as well as genetic testing at inclusion. All patients had their medication changed to tiotropium/olodaterol. Results: Groups did not differ according to age, sex, smoking status, pack-years, or COPD duration. We found that patients with the Gln27Gln polymorphism had the lowest GOLD grading, D. No difference was found in the number of exacerbations, hospitalizations, and out-patient exacerbations in the year prior to inclusion and the study year. Tiotropium/olodaterol were comparable in all study groups in reducing exacerbations and hospitalizations. There was no significant difference in mMRC and CAT values between the groups. We found that Gln27Gln patients required less antibiotics at inclusion and less glucocorticoids at the end of the study. Tiotrpium/olodaterol showed variable results for different genotypes regarding the reduction in use of different drugs.

Agar well diffusion was used to generate zones of inhibition against Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Staphylococcus aureus while broth dilutions were used to study the minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs). Non-peroxide activity was investigated by catalase for hydrogen peroxide reduction. The Cameroonian honeys demonstrated functional properties similar to Manuka honey, with strong correlations between the antioxidant activity and total phenol content of each honey. They were also as effective as Manuka honey in reducing bacteria load with an MIC of 10% w/v against all three bacteria and exhibited non-peroxide antimicrobial activity. These Cameroon honeys have potential therapeutic activity and may contain compounds with activity against Gram positive and Gram negative bacteria.

This is most likely because researchers are concerned about inducing cross-linking of proteins via amide bonds, leading to artefactual charge modification and thus resulting in irreproducible results and bad gels. Indeed, it is known that lyophilization can cause crosslinking. The potential reaction is a reaction of free amino groups of a protein with the reducing group of sugar molecules. The rate and extent of this reaction depends on the sugar content of the sample, the efficiency of lyophilization process, the residual water content of the material and the storage temperature. Lyophilization is a cheap, practical and safe alternative for the storage and transportation of samples prior to protein extraction, separation and quantification via 2DE, when care is taken (i) to dry the samples to the lowest practicable moisture content, (ii) to transport and store them under water- and airtight conditions and (iii) to avoid heating of the sample.", "DOI": "10.1002/pmic.200700529", "len_ids": "023-060-361-261-660", "time": [2018, 5, 12], "source": "7question/lens", "label": "Yes.", "answer": "yes"}

{"title": "Are adverse effects of cannabidiol (CBD) products caused by tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) contamination?", "abstract": "Cannabidiol (CBD)-containing products are widely marketed as over the counter products, mostly as food supplements. Adverse effects reported in anecdotal consumer reports or during clinical studies were first assumed to be due to hydrolytic conversion of CBD to psychotropic \u03949-tetrahydrocannabinol (\u03949-THC) in the stomach after oral consumption. However, research of pure CBD solutions stored in simulated gastric juice or subjected to various storage conditions such as heat and light with specific liquid chromatographic/tandem mass spectrometric (LC/MS/MS) and ultra-high pressure liquid chromatographic/quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometric (UPLC-QTOF) analyses was unable to confirm THC formation. Another hypothesis for the adverse effects of CBD products may be residual \u03949-THC concentrations in the products as contamination, because most of them are based on hemp extracts containing the full spectrum of cannabinoids besides CBD. Analyses of 181 food products of the German market (mostly CBD oils) confirmed this hypothesis: 21 products (12%) contained \u03949-THC above the lowest observed adverse effect level (2.5 mg/day). Inversely, CBD was present in the products below the no observed adverse effect level. Hence, it may be assumed that the adverse effects of some commercial CBD products are based on a low-dose effect of \u03949-THC and not due to effects of CBD itself. The safety, efficacy and purity of commercial CBD products is highly questionable, and all of the products in our sample collection showed various non-conformities to European food law such as unsafe \u03949-THC levels, hemp extracts or CBD isolates as non-approved novel food ingredients, non-approved health claims, and deficits in mandatory food labelling requirements.

In this paper, we study whether the 125 GeV boson could be the pseudo-Goldstone boson of Little Higgs models. We derive limits on the parameter space of several Little Higgs models , both from the experimental data from ATLAS and CMS about the different Higgs discovery channel and the electroweak precision observables. We perform a fit of several Little Higgs models to all electroweak parameters from measurements of SLC, LEP, Tevatron, and LHC. For the Higgs searches, we include all available data from the summer conferences in 2012 as well as the updates from December 2012. We show that there always exists a region in the parameter space of the models under consideration where the measured chi^2 is equal or lower than the SM chi^2: a closer look at the minimum chi^2 will however reveal that the agreement with the collected data is not significantly better as within the SM. While for the models without T-parity the Little Higgs scale f is forced to be of the order 2-4 TeV in order to be compatible with the collected data, in the models with T-parity the scale f is constrained to be only above O(500) GeV, reducing the amount of fine-tuning.

{"title": "Hexabromocyclododecane in polystyrene packaging: A downside of recycling?", "abstract": "While there are no regulatory fire safety obligations for polystyrene (PS) when used as packaging material, concerns exist that such packaging material may contain the flame retardant hexabromocyclododecane (HBCDD) as a result of uncontrolled recycling activities. To evaluate these concerns, we collected 50 samples of PS packaging materials from the UK and 20 from Ireland. HBCDD was detected in 63 (90%) of samples, with concentrations in 4 samples from Ireland exceeding the EU's low POP concentration limit (LPCL) of 0.1% above which articles may not be recycled. Moreover, 2 further samples contained HBCDD >0.01%. While our samples were obtained in the 12 month period prior to the March 2016 introduction of the EU's 0.01% concentration limit above which articles may not be placed on the market, our data suggest that continued monitoring is required to assess compliance with this limit value. Ratios of \u03b1 vs. \u03b3-HBCDD in our EPS packaging samples (average\u202f=\u202f0.63) exceeded significantly (p\u202f=\u202f0.025) those in EPS building insulation material samples (average\u202f=\u202f0.24) reported previously for Ireland. This shift towards \u03b1-HBCDD in packaging EPS is consistent with the additional thermal processing experienced by recycled PS and suggests the source of HBCDD in PS packaging is recycled PS insulation foam. This is of concern owing to the higher bioavailability and lower metabolic clearance of \u03b1-HBCDD compared to the \u03b2- and \u03b3-isomers.", "DOI": "10.1016/j.chemosphere.2018.02.084", "len_ids": "080-681-778-851-18X", "time": [2018, 5, 13], "source": "question/lens", "label": "Yes.", "answer": "yes"}

The linkers included three isophthalic acid derivatives , thiophene-2,5-dicarboxylic acid (H2TDC), and two 4,4'-sulfonyldibenzoic acid derivatives (H2SDBA, DPSTA). The crystal structures of seven compounds were elucidated by a combination of model building, single-crystal X-ray diffraction (SCXRD), three-dimensional electron diffraction (3D ED), and Rietveld refinements against powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD) data. Four new Ga-MOFs that are isoreticular with their aluminum counterparts, i.e. Ga-CAU-10-R (Ga(OH)(m-BDC-R); R = OCH3, NHCOCH3), Ga-CAU-11 (Ga(OH)(SDBA)), and Ga-CAU-11-COOH (Ga(OH)(H2DPSTC)), were obtained. For the first time large single crystals of a MOF crystallizing in the CAU-10 structure type could be isolated, i.e. Ga-CAU-10-OCH3, which permitted a detailed structural characterization. In addition, the use of 5-methylisophthalic acid and thiophene-2,5-dicarboxylic acid resulted in two new Ga-MOFs denoted Ga-CAU-49 and Ga-CAU-51, respectively, which are not isostructural with any known Al-MOF. The crystal structure of Ga-CAU-49 ([Ga4(m-HBDC-CH3)2(m-BDC-CH3)3(OH)4(H2O)]) contains an unprecedented rod-shaped inorganic building unit (IBU) of the formula \u221e1{Ga16(OH)18O60}, composed of corner-sharing GaO5 and GaO6 polyhedra.

Only T. pyriformis models demonstrated lower coverage for drugs and pesticides (38% and 54%, respectively). These results show that, for the most part, historical QSAR models built with data available for different toxicity endpoints can be used for toxicity assessment of novel chemicals irrespective of the intended commercial use; however, the AD restriction is necessary to assure the expected prediction accuracy.

Our aim is to address the evolution of cluster-forming clumps. We observed the same 14 clusters in C18O, which are located at distances from 0.3-2.1kpc with 27\" resolution in H13CO+. We detected the 13 clumps in H13CO+ line emission and obtained the physical parameters of the clumps with radii of 0.24-0.75pc, masses of 100-1400Msun, and velocity widths in FWHM of 1.5-4.0kms^-1. The mean density is 3.9x10^4cm^-3 and the equivalent Jeans length is 0.13pc at 20K. We classified the H13CO+ clumps into three types, Type A, B, and C according to the relative locations of the H13CO+ clumps and the clusters. Our classification represents an evolutionary trend of cluster-forming clumps because dense clumps are expected to be converted into stellar constituents, or dispersed by stellar activities. We found a similar but clearer trend than our previous results for derived star formation efficiencies to increase from Type A to C in the H13CO+ data, and for the dense gas regions within the clumps traced by H13CO+ to be sensitive to the physical evolution of clump-cluster systems. In addition, we found that four out of 13 H13CO+ clumps which we named DVSOs(Distinct Velocity Structure Objects) have distinct velocity gradients at the central parts of them. Assuming that the velocity gradients represent the rigid-like rotation of the clumps, we calculated the virial parameter of the H13CO+ clumps by taking into account the contribution of rotation, and found that the DVSOs tend to be gravitationally unbound. In order to explain the above physical properties for DVSOs, we propose a clump-clump collision model as a possible mechanism for triggering formation of clusters.", "DOI": "10.1088/0004-637X/719/2/1813", "source": "arxiv", "time": [2015, 5, 19], "label": "Yes.", "answer": "yes"}

A Systematic Review.", "abstract": "In this study, we aimed to systematicallyreview the current evidence regarding the diagnostic accuracy of ultrasound in assessing adnexal masses in pregnancy. The Cochrane Register of Controlled Trials, PubMed, and EMBASE databases were searched for all types of clinical studies that utilised ultrasound for the diagnosis of adnexal masses in pregnancy. Only studies that used outcome measures of either histological diagnosis or significant regression of the adnexal mass on imaging follow-up were included. The quality of each study was assessed for risk of bias. The diagnostic performance of ultrasound in each study type was calculated, along with the pooled diagnostic performance of ultrasound in differentiating benign from malignant masses. The initial search yielded 4,915 articles, of which 2,547 qualified for abstract screening. A total of 83 articles were included in this review, including one prospective cohort study, six retrospective observational studies, seven case series, and 69 case reports. In the included studies, the total number of adnexal masses was 559. The mean patient age was 29.2 years (95% confidence interval [CI]: 28.7-29.7), with a mean gestational age at diagnosis of 13.8 weeks (95% CI: 13.2-14.4). The mean quality assessment score was 75%. The International Ovarian Tumour Analysis Simple Rules were used in two articles, whereas subjective impression was used in the remaining 81 articles. The most frequently diagnosed mass was a simple or physiological cyst (35%). The prevalence of malignancy in the entire sample was 46/559 (8%; 95% CI: 34-61%). The overall pooled sensitivity, specificity, positive likelihood ratio, and negative likelihood ratio of ultrasound in detecting ovarian malignancy were 64% (95% CI: 30-88%), 88% (95% CI: 64-97%), 5.6 (95% CI: 1.2-25.4), and 0.4 (95% CI: 0.15-1), respectively. In conclusion, currently, there is a lack of high-quality prospective studies to guide the management of adnexal masses in pregnancy.

Beyond the significant advances in improving its initial activity, securing catalytic durability is the next challenge for the successful implementation of PEMFCs. Encapsulation of Pt nanoparticles (NPs) with thin carbon or silica layers has recently been highlighted as a promising strategy for alleviating Pt degradation. However, unexpectedly similar or occasionally even better catalytic activity on site-blocked Pt NPs has raised fundamental interest about the nature of their catalytic sites and the origin of the prolonged durability. Herein, to answer these questions, we investigate the ORR and methanol oxidation reaction activities of carbon-encapsulated Pt NP (C@Pt/C) catalysts. By controlling the robustness of the carbon shells synthetically and electrochemically, directly exposed Pt sites, at which facile transport of reactant/product molecules occurs via the loosely packed or highly defective carbon layers, are identified as the main catalytic sites. Interestingly, online differential electrochemical mass spectroscopy and inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry coupled to electrochemical flow cells verify a trade-off relationship between the activity and stability of the catalysts. In addition to their role as a physical barrier for prohibiting the dissolution and agglomeration of the Pt NPs, the carbon shell acts as a sacrificial agent, questioning the practical legitimacy of the strategy for achieving both high activity and durability.", "DOI": "10.1021/acscatal.2c01618", "len_ids": "001-937-638-568-201", "time": [2022, 6, 8], "source": "question/lens", "label": "Yes.", "answer": "no"}

Simulation of the observed powder pattern for both K- and Q-band consistently points to a defect of orthorhombic symmetry characterized by g 1 = 1.880 \u00b1 0.006, g 2 = 1.900 \u00b1 0.006, g 3 = 1.981 \u00b1 0.0015. Analysis based on the inferred spectroscopic ESR characteristics in comparison with previous theoretical work leads to the suggestion that the observed center may concern an O-vacancy defect, closest perhaps to the 4-fold 1 + charged O-vacancy (V O4 + ). The revealed defect may account, at least partly, for the previously reported distinct propensity of positive charge trapping in Si/hafnia structures grown by ALCVD and MOCVD.", "DOI": "10.1016/j.mee.2017.04.035", "len_ids": "004-919-233-284-745", "time": [2018, 5, 12], "source": "question/lens", "label": "Yes.", "answer": "yes"}
{"title": "Does damming streams alter the water use strategies of riparian trees? A case\u2010study in a subtropic climate", "abstract": "Understand the mechanism governing degradation of riparian forests in response to damming streams is needed for a comprehensive impact assessment of dams in relation to protection of river ecosystems. However, the ascription of riparian forest degradation to the hydrological changes induced by dams lacks of direct proof and the hypothesis that dam construction alters the water use strategy of riparian trees is yet to be tested. In this study, the water sources of riparian trees grown upstream and downstream of dams at SW China, were investigated by dual isotopes and a Bayesian model. We observed that xylem water in downstream Populus adenopoda had significantly lower line-conditioned excess values than upstream trees. The water source of upstream trees was barely subjected to evaporation. Upstream mature and young P. adenopoda trees both acquired more streamwater than groundwater or soil water . Downstream mature and young P. adenopoda trees both largely used soil water as main water source. In contrast, Pterocarya stenoptera highly depended on streamwater, regardless of size and location, implying that damming had little effect on this species. Damming streams may increase water competition among downstream riparian trees, which could explain declines in growth rate, canopy dieback, tree death, and eventually downstream land degradation. We believe that this study is of significant value for research into riparian forest degradation resulting from hydrological changes, and in particular to apprehend the impact of small dams, which has barely been studied.", "DOI": "10.1002/ldr.3500", "len_ids": "087-795-211-969-865", "time": [2019, 12, 3], "source": "question/lens", "label": "Yes.", "answer": "yes"}

Current energy targets are sometimes considered of limited use by facility professionals in health care because they do not take account of differences in service delivery between acute hospitals which result in differing use of medical equipment and requirements for room conditioning. For this study, the electricity use of a number of department types has been quantified using on-site measurements. Findings confirm that different hospital departments have hugely varied electricity consumption characteristics. Wards, day clinics and some other departments have lower average consumption intensities which are reasonably well reflected by current hospital electricity benchmarks. Theatres, laboratories and also departments such as imaging and radiotherapy showed much higher consumption intensities exceeding available targets. A revision of current energy benchmarks for the latter category is therefore strongly recommended. It is further proposed to develop composite benchmarks for hospitals taking into account differing energy intensities at a departmental level for guidance and as basis for certification.", "DOI": "10.1016/j.enbuild.2016.02.052", "len_ids": "060-831-041-187-62X", "time": [2018, 5, 12], "source": "question/lens", "label": "Yes.", "answer": "yes"}

Within these filaments, at a projected distance of ~40 kpc from the galaxy, we discover an ultra-diffuse galaxy (UDG) with a central surface brightness of $\\mu_{0,g}\\sim26$ mag arcsec$^{-2}$ and effective radius $R_e\\sim3.8$ kpc. This UDG, named UDG32, is one of the faintest and most diffuse low-surface brightness galaxies in the Hydra~I cluster. Based on the available data, we cannot exclude that this object is just seen in projection on top of the stellar filaments, thus being instead a foreground or background UDG in the cluster. However, the clear spatial coincidence of UDG32 with the stellar filaments of NGC3314A suggests that it might have formed from the material in the filaments, becoming a detached, gravitationally bound system. In this scenario, the origin of UDG32 depends on the nature of the stellar filaments in NGC3314A, which is still unknown. They could result from ram-pressure stripping or have a tidal origin. In this letter, we focus on the comparison of the observed properties of the stellar filaments and UDG32, and speculate about their possible origin. The relatively red color ($g-r=0.54 \\pm 0.14$~mag) of the UDG, similar to that of the disk in NGC3314A, combined with an age older than 1Gyr, and the possible presence of a few compact stellar systems, all point towards a tidal formation scenario inferred for the UDG32.", "DOI": "10.1051/0004-6361/202141086", "source": "arxiv", "time": [2021, 8, 25], "label": "Yes.", "answer": "yes"}

The relatively high present gas content and low metallicity suggest only modest D-destruction.

We have explored a variety of chemical evolution models including infall of processed material and early, supernovae-driven winds with the aim of identifying models with large D-destruction which are consistent with the observations of stellar-produced heavy elements. When such models are confronted with data we reconfirm that only modest destruction of deuterium is permitted.

The initial angular momentum of a core may be responsible for its fragmentation and can have an influence on the size of the protoplanetary disk. To understand how cores obtain their initial angular momentum, it is important to study the angular momentum of filaments where they form. While theoretical studies on filament rotation have been explored, there exist very few observational measurements of the specific angular momentum in star-forming filaments. We present high-resolution N2D+ ALMA observations of the LBS 23 (HH24-HH26) region in Orion B, which provide one of the most reliable measurements of the specific angular momentum in a star-forming filament. We find the total specific angular momentum ($4 \\times 10^{20} cm^2s^{-1}$), the dependence of the specific angular momentum with radius (j(r) $\\propto r^{1.83}$), and the ratio of rotational energy to gravitational energy ($\\beta_{rot} \\sim 0.04$) comparable to those observed in rotating cores with sizes similar to our filament width ($\\sim$ 0.04 pc) in other star-forming regions.

Dihydrolipoamide dehydrogenase (LipHD) preferentially reduces R-lipoic acid and in a subsequent reaction, the R-dihydrolipoic acid formed may non-enzymatically reduce S-lipoic acid. Using circular dichroism (CD) spectroscopy, the second order rate constant of the latter reaction was determined . In vitro, it was found that S-lipoic acid is reduced by LipDH using R-lipoic acid as a catalyst. The non-enzymatic dithiol-disulfide reaction leads to synergistic reduction of the enan- tiomers which can explain the higher antioxidant activity of racemic lipoic acid found in vivo in comparison to the enantiomers. Lipoic acid is therapeutically active in several diseases via antioxi- dant activity. These findings suggest that racemic lipoic acid can be therapeutically more active than the separate enantiomers.

A representative set of 12 elements - As, Ba, Br, Ca, Cl, K, Mg, Mn, Na, Sr, V, Zn - was used for an ab initio comparison between raw data and Rb-normalized data, using distribution-free statistics. Correlation analysis shows an overall improvement in the degree of association between bark and lichen signals when proceeding from raw data to relative enrichment. Apart from Cl, no element is enriched in lichens to a higher extent than in bark. Sign tests are quite conclusive: bark factors are either statistically greater than or equal to lichens'.

{"title": "The Ecobonus Incentive Scheme and Energy Poverty: Is Energy Efficiency for All?", "abstract": "With 2017, National Energy Strategy, Italy introduced a definition of energy poverty, combining three elements: the presence of a high level of energy expenditure, an amount of total expenditure below the relative poverty threshold and a null value for the purchase of heating products. The Integrated National Plan for Energy and Climate adopts the same definition, provides an estimation on the evolution of energy poverty in 2030 and lists the tax deduction scheme for energy renovation of the existing building stock (Ecobonus) among the specific measures dedicated to energy poverty. Implemented as an alternative measure under Article 7 of EED (European Energy Efficiency Directive), Ecobonus enables the households in the no-tax area\u2014which are likely to be energy poor\u2014to transfer their tax credits to financial institutions, work suppliers or other private entities, reducing the investment cost for energy/efficiency interventions. Based on information at the regional level, namely ENEA microdata on Ecobonus, this paper examines the possible relationship between indicators such as household income and the access to Ecobonus. Additionally, the study analyzes if this relationship changes for the different categories of interventions incentivized by Ecobonus, such as the replacement of windows and shutters or of heating systems. The hypothesis is that the incentive measure, with its current approach, has a regressive distributive effect on households, and it does not effectively support energy-poverty eradication.

This class of hydrolases is unique in requiring essential post-translational modification of a critical active-site cysteinyl or seryl residue to C(alpha)-formylglycine (FGly). Herein, we report mechanistic investigations of a unique class of radical-S-adenosyl-L-methionine (AdoMet) enzymes, namely anaerobic sulfatase-maturating enzymes (anSMEs), which catalyze the oxidation of Cys-type and Ser-type sulfatases and possess three [4Fe-4S](2+,+) clusters. We were able to develop a reliable quantitative enzymatic assay that allowed the direct measurement of FGly production and AdoMet cleavage.

{"title": "Rescoring of docking poses under Occam\u2019s Razor: are there simpler solutions?", "abstract": "Ligand affinity prediction from docking simulations is usually performed by means of highly empirical and diverse protocols. These protocols often involve the re-scoring of poses generated by a force field (FF) based Hamiltonian to provide either estimated binding affinities\u2014or alternatively, some empirical goodness score. Re-scoring is performed by so-called scoring functions\u2014typically, a reweighted sum of FF terms augmented by additional terms . Sometimes, the scoring function actually drives ligand positioning, but often it only operates on the best scoring poses ranked top by the initial ligand positioning tool. In either of these rather intricate scenarios, scoring functions are docking-specific models, and most require machine-learning-based calibration. Therefore, docking simulations are less straightforward when compared to \u201cstandard\u201d molecular simulations in which the FF Hamiltonian defines the energy, and affinity emerges as an ensemble average property over pools of representative conformers (i.e., the trajectory). Paraphrasing on Occam\u2019s Razor principle, additional model complexity is only acceptable if demonstrated to bring a significant improvement of prediction quality. In this work we therefore examined whether the complexity inherent to scoring functions is indeed justified. For this purpose we compared sampler for multiple protein\u2013ligand entities, a general purpose conformation sampler based on the AMBER/GAFF FF, complemented with continuum solvation terms, with several state of the art docking tools that rely on calibrated scoring functions (Glide, Gold, Autodock-Vina) in terms of its ability to top-rank the actives from large and diverse ligand series associated with various proteins. There is no clear winner of this study, where each program performed well on most of the targets, but also failed with respect to at least one of them. Therefore, a well-parameterized force field with a simple, energy-based ligand ranking protocol appears to be an as effective docking protocol as intricate rescoring strategies based on scoring functions. A tool that can sample the conformational space of the free ligand, the bound ligand and the protein binding site using the same force field may avoid many of the approximations common to contemporary docking protocols and allow e.g., for docking into highly flexible active sites, when current scoring functions are not well suited to estimate receptor strain energies.", "DOI": "10.1007/s10822-018-0155-5", "len_ids": "016-278-866-652-761", "time": [2018, 9, 10], "source": "question/lens", "label": "yes", "answer": "maybe"}

However, the host reaction, reflected by the intensity of the inflammatory response to bacterial products, is crucial for peri-implant bone destruction. The aim of this pilot study was to measure total antioxidant status (TAS), the amount of IL-6, IL-8 and TNF-\u03b1 (tumor necrosis factor), salivary lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) levels and the correlation with one-year peri-implant bone loss. Methods: Seven consecutive patients (Group 1), with the presence of at least one prior inserted dental implant, and three healthy individuals, fully dentate (Group 0), were enrolled. IL-6, IL-8, TNF-\u03b1, TAS and LDH were determined in saliva of both groups. Peri-implant marginal bone loss (MBL) at one year compared to baseline was evaluated for Group 1. Results: A statistically significant positive correlation was found in Group 1 between MBL and the IL-8 (p = 0.033) and a strong negative correlation between MBL and TAS (p = 0.002), but no statistically significant differences of the assessed parameters were found between the two groups.

{"title": "Are Bronsted Acids the True Promoter of Metal-Triflate-Catalyzed Glycosylations? A Mechanistic Probe into 1,2-cis-Aminoglycoside Formation by Nickel Triflate", "abstract": "Metal triflates have been utilized to catalytically facilitate numerous glycosylation reactions under mild conditions. In some methods, the metal triflate system provides stereocontrol during the glycosylation, rather than the nature of protecting groups on the substrate. Despite these advances, the true activating nature of metal triflates remains unclear. Our findings indicated that the in situ generation of trace amounts of triflic acid from metal triflates can be the active catalyst species in the glycosylation. This fact has been mentioned previously in metal-triflate-catalyzed glycosylation reactions; however, a thorough study on the subject and its implications on stereoselectivity has yet to be performed. Experimental evidence from control reactions and 19F NMR spectroscopy have been obtained to confirm and quantify the triflic acid released from nickel triflate, for which it is of paramount importance in achieving a stereoselective 1,2-cis-2-amino glycosidic bond formation via a transient anomeric triflate. A putative intermediate resembling that of a glycosyl triflate has been detected using variable temperature NMR (1H and 13C) experiments. These observations, together with density functional theory calculations and a kinetic study, corroborate a mechanism involving triflic-acid-catalyzed stereoselective glycosylation with N-substituted trifluoromethylbenzylideneamino-protected electrophiles. Specifically, triflic acid facilitates formation of a glycosyl triflate intermediate which then undergoes isomerization from the stable \u03b1-anomer to the more reactive \u03b2-anomer. Subsequent SN2-like displacement of the reactive anomer by a nucleophile is highly favorable for the production of 1,2-cis-2-aminoglycosides. Although there is a previously reported work regarding glycosyl triflates, none of these reports have been confirmed to come from the counterion of the metal center. Our work provides supporting evidence for the induction of a glycosyl triflate through the role of triflic acid in metal-triflate-catalyzed glycosylation reactions", "DOI": "10.1021/acscatal.8b04444.s002", "len_ids": "187-347-216-232-789", "time": [2020, 4, 19], "source": "1search_engine/lens", "label": "Yes.", "answer": "yes"}

{"title": "Does telecommuting save energy? A critical review of quantitative studies and their research methods", "abstract": "Teleworking has been widely perceived as a more sustainable mode of working for knowledge workers compared to the status quo of commuting to centralized offices because of its reduced dependency on transportation and centralized office space. However, the situation is far more complex than would appear on the surface, when the scope is expanded to include home office energy use, the Internet, long-term consumer choices, and other so-called rebound effects. Few studies have quantified home, office, transportation, and communications energy or GHG emissions implications of telecommuting simultaneously. To make progress in answering the question of whether telecommuting results in less energy use and greenhouse gas emissions than conventional centralized office working, this paper reviews results and research methods of primarily quantitative studies of any and all four domains that consider operating energy and/or greenhouse gas emissions. The results ultimately show that this problem is complex, and that current datasets and methods are generally inadequate for fully answering the research question.

This raises the question of whether classical 2D fingerprints are still valuable in computer-aided drug discovery. This work considers 23 datasets associated with four typical problems, namely protein-ligand binding, toxicity, solubility and partition coefficient to assess the performance of eight 2D fingerprints. Advanced machine learning algorithms including random forest, gradient boosted decision tree, single-task deep neural network and multitask deep neural network are employed to construct efficient 2D-fingerprint based models. Additionally, appropriate consensus models are built to further enhance the performance of 2D-fingerprintbased methods. It is demonstrated that 2D-fingerprint-based models perform as well as the state-of-the-art 3D structure-based models for the predictions of toxicity, solubility, partition coefficient and protein-ligand binding affinity based on only ligand information.

Multi-wavelength observations are indispensable in studying disk geometry and dust evolution processes in protoplanetary disks. Aims. We aimed to construct a 3-dimensional model of HD 163296 capable of reproducing simultaneously new observations of the disk surface in scattered light with the SPHERE instrument and thermal emission continuum observations of the disk midplane with ALMA. We want to determine why the SED of HD 163296 is intermediary between the otherwise well-separated group I and group II Herbig stars. Methods. The disk was modelled using the Monte Carlo radiative transfer code MCMax3D. The radial dust surface density profile was modelled after the ALMA observations, while the polarized scattered light observations were used to constrain the inclination of the inner disk component and turbulence and grain growth in the outer disk. Results. While three rings are observed in the disk midplane in millimeter thermal emission at $\\sim$80, 124 and 200 AU, only the innermost of these is observed in polarized scattered light, indicating a lack of small dust grains on the surface of the outer disk. We provide two models capable of explaining this difference. The first model uses increased settling in the outer disk as a mechanism to bring the small dust grains on the surface of the disk closer to the midplane, and into the shadow cast by the first ring. The second model uses depletion of the smallest dust grains in the outer disk as a mechanism for decreasing the optical depth at optical and NIR wavelengths. In the region outside the fragmentation-dominated regime, such depletion is expected from state-of-the-art dust evolution models. We studied the effect of creating an artificial inner cavity in our models, and conclude that HD 163296 might be a precursor to typical group I sources.", "DOI": "10.1051/0004-6361/201732299", "source": "arxiv", "time": [2018, 6, 13], "label": "Yes.", "answer": "yes"}

The analysis of metals and pathogens, based on the Brazilian Resolution 498/2020 of the National Council for the Environment (CONAMA), classified the residue as suitable for incorporation into crop soils in Brazil. However, all concentrations of the biosolid (6.25, 25, 50, and 100%) caused phytotoxicity to Lactuca sativa, Allium cepa, Cucumis sativus, and Triticum aestivum. A. cepa meristematic cells exposed to the residue revealed division disruption, including clastogenic damage to chromosomes, and death. All concentrations promoted swelling in onion roots, drastic inhibition of ascorbate peroxidase and superoxide dismutase, activation of guaiacol peroxidase, and lipid peroxidation in their meristems. Studies with Eisenia fetida showed biosolid has strong repellent effects and higher concentrations caused 100% mortality. In surviving animals, catalase and guaiacol peroxidase showed higher tissue levels of activity, suggesting a response to increased environmental free radicals, including reactive oxygen species.

To study this further, spectroscopic studies on the reaction of CblNO2 with the intracellular antioxidant ascorbic acid (HAsc\u2212) were performed in aqueous solution at pH < 5.0. It was found that nitroxylcobalamin is the final product of this interaction, which is not just a simple reaction but a rather complex chemical process. We clearly show that an excess of nitrite suppresses the formation of CblNO, from which it follows that ascorbic acid cannot reduce coordinated nitrite. We propose that under the influence of ascorbic acid, nitrocobalamin is reduced to Cbl(II) and nitric oxide (\u00b7NO), which can subsequently react rapidly to form CblNO.

As the lateral size of nanowires decreases, the values of Young's modulus decrease and dislocation nucleation stresses increase.

{"title": "Ethnic skin types: are there differences in skin structure and function?", "abstract": "People of skin of colour comprise the majority of the world's population and Asian subjects comprise more than half of the total population of the earth. Even so, the literature on the characteristics of the subjects with skin of colour is limited. Several groups over the past decades have attempted to decipher the underlying differences in skin structure and function in different ethnic skin types. However, most of these studies have been of small scale and in some studies interindividual differences in skin quality overwhelm any racial differences. There has been a recent call for more studies to address genetic together with phenotypic differences among different racial groups and in this respect several large-scale studies have been conducted recently. The most obvious ethnic skin difference relates to skin colour which is dominated by the presence of melanin. The photoprotection derived from this polymer influences the rate of the skin aging changes between the different racial groups. However, all racial groups are eventually subjected to the photoaging process. Generally Caucasians have an earlier onset and greater skin wrinkling and sagging signs than other skin types and in general increased pigmentary problems are seen in skin of colour although one large study reported that East Asians living in the U.S.A. had the least pigment spots. Induction of a hyperpigmentary response is thought to be through signaling by the protease-activated receptor-2 which together with its activating protease is increased in the epidermis of subjects with skin of colour. Changes in skin biophysical properties with age demonstrate that the more darkly pigmented subjects retaining younger skin properties compared with the more lightly pigmented groups. However, despite having a more compact stratum corneum (SC) there are conflicting reports on barrier function in these subjects. Nevertheless, upon a chemical or mechanical challenge the SC barrier function is reported to be stronger in subjects with darker skin despite having the reported lowest ceramide levels. One has to remember that barrier function relates to the total architecture of the SC and not just its lipid levels. Asian skin is reported to possess a similar basal transepidermal water loss (TEWL) to Caucasian skin and similar ceramide levels but upon mechanical challenge it has the weakest barrier function. Differences in intercellular cohesion are obviously apparent. In contrast reduced SC natural moisturizing factor levels have been reported compared with Caucasian and African American skin. These differences will contribute to differences in desquamation but few data are available. One recent study has shown reduced epidermal Cathepsin L2 levels in darker skin types which if also occurs in the SC could contribute to the known skin ashing problems these subjects experience. In very general terms as the desquamatory enzymes are extruded with the lamellar granules subjects with lowered SC lipid levels are expected to have lowered desquamatory enzyme levels. Increased pores size, sebum secretion and skin surface microflora occur in Negroid subjects. Equally increased mast cell granule size occurs in these subjects. The frequency of skin sensitivity is quite similar across different racial groups but the stimuli for its induction shows subtle differences. Nevertheless, several studies indicate that Asian skin maybe more sensitive to exogenous chemicals probably due to a thinner SC and higher eccrine gland density. In conclusion, we know more of the biophysical and somatosensory characteristics of ethnic skin types but clearly, there is still more to learn and especially about the inherent underlying biological differences in ethnic skin types.", "DOI": "10.1111/j.1467-2494.2006.00302.x", "len_ids": "039-993-546-672-170", "time": [2018, 5, 12], "source": "question/lens", "label": "Yes.", "answer": "yes"}

Methods We measured nine phthalate metabolites in urine samples from 210 mother/infant pairs collected on the same study visit day (1999\u20132005) and obtained demographic history from questionnaires. Using multivariate linear regression analyses, we examined the degree to which maternal urine phthalate metabolite concentration predicted infant phthalate metabolite concentration. All analyses were adjusted for infant age, creatinine concentration, and race. Results Correlation coefficients between phthalate metabolite concentrations in the urine of mothers and their infants were generally low but increased with decreasing age of infant. In multivariate analyses, mother's phthalate metabolite concentrations were significantly associated with infants\u2019 concentrations for six phthalate metabolites: monobenzyl phthalate, monoethyl phthalate, monoisobutyl phthalate, and three metabolites of di(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate: mono(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate, mono(2-ethyl-5-hydroxy-hexyl) phthalate, and mono(2-ethyl-5-oxo-hexyl) phthalate (p-values for all coefficients <0.05).

This study indicates the importance of further identifying infant phthalate exposures that may be distinct from maternal exposures in order to decrease overall infant phthalate exposures.", "source": "material/elsevier_final", "label": "Yes.", "answer": "yes"}
{"title": "Can Formal Security Verification Really Be Optional? Scrutinizing the Security of IMD Authentication Protocols.", "abstract": "The need for continuous monitoring of physiological information of critical organs of the human body, combined with the ever-growing field of electronics and sensor technologies and the vast opportunities brought by 5G connectivity, have made implantable medical devices (IMDs) the most necessitated devices in the health arena. IMDs are very sensitive since they are implanted in the human body, and the patients depend on them for the proper functioning of their vital organs. Simultaneously, they are intrinsically vulnerable to several attacks mainly due to their resource limitations and the wireless channel utilized for data transmission. Hence, failing to secure them would put the patient's life in jeopardy and damage the reputations of the manufacturers. To date, various researchers have proposed different countermeasures to keep the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of IMD systems with privacy and safety specifications. Despite the appreciated efforts made by the research community, there are issues with these proposed solutions. Principally, there are at least three critical problems. (1) Inadequate essential capabilities ; (2) heavy computational and communication overheads; and (3) lack of rigorous formal security verification. Motivated by this, we have thoroughly analyzed the current IMD authentication protocols by utilizing two formal approaches: the Burrows-Abadi-Needham logic (BAN logic) and the Automated Validation of Internet Security Protocols and Applications (AVISPA). In addition, we compared these schemes against their security strengths, computational overheads, latency, and other vital features, such as emergency authentications, key update mechanisms, and adaptabilities.", "DOI": "10.3390/s21248383", "len_ids": "055-137-675-794-850", "time": [2022, 1, 2], "source": "question/lens", "label": "Yes.", "answer": "no"}
{"title": "Can Hydrogen Catalyze Transitions Between H-BN and C-BN in Volume Plasma?", "abstract": "In a range of temperatures from 1500 to 2500 K, processes of transformation between various nanometer-scale boron nitride structures in the presence of hydrogen are simulated. We find that hydrogen catalyzes the transition from the sp2 hybridization of B and N atoms in hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN) to sp3 hybridization, creating tetrahedral amorphous boron nitride (ta-BN) or cubic boron nitride (c-BN), at 1500 and 2000 K, respectively. At 2000 K in the presence of hydrogen, ta-BN can evolve to c-BN, usually partially encapsulated by a h-BN cage. All of these transformational processes of boron nitrides have analogs in graphene-diamond conversions. Change of atom hybridization can also proceed in the opposite direction under different conditions. Using quantum-classical molecular dynamics based on the density functional tight-binding method, we analyze the evolution of the nanoscale particles via the hybridization state of B/N atoms, ring composition, exchange of particles with environment, as well as the...", "DOI": "10.1021/acs.jpcc.7b10955", "len_ids": "002-874-300-130-545", "time": [2018, 5, 13], "source": "question/lens", "label": "yes", "answer": "yes"}
{"title": "On faint companions in the close environment of star-forming dwarf galaxies. Possible external star formation triggers ?", "abstract": "We have searched for companion galaxies in the close environment of 98 star-forming dwarf galaxies (SFDGs) from field and low density environments, using the NASA Extragalactic Database. Most of the companions are dwarf galaxies which due to observational selection effects were previously disregarded in environmental studies of SFDGs. A subsample at low redshift, cz<2000 km/s, was chosen to partially eliminate the observational bias against distant dwarf companions. We find companion candidates for approximately 30% of the objects within a projected linear separation s_p<100 kpc and a redshift difference (Delta cz)<500 km/s. The limited completeness of the available data sets, together with the non-negligible frequency of HI clouds in the vicinity of SFDGs indicated by recent radio surveys, suggest that a considerably larger fraction of these galaxies may be accompanied by low-mass systems. This casts doubt on the hypothesis that the majority of them can be considered truly isolated. The velocity differences between companion candidates and sample SFDGs amount typically to (Delta cz)<250 km/s, and show a rising distribution towards lower (Delta cz). This is similarly found for dwarf satellites of spiral galaxies, suggesting a physical association between the companion candidates and the sample SFDGs. SFDGs with a close companion do not show significant differences in their Hbeta equivalent widths and B-V colours as compared to isolated ones. However, the available data do not allow us to rule out that interactions with close dwarf companions can influence the star formation activity in SFDGs.", "DOI": "10.1051/0004-6361:20010446", "source": "arxiv", "time": [2009, 11, 6], "label": "Yes.", "answer": "maybe"}

Here, we investigate spatial variability in calcification and organic production at One Tree Island (OTI) and compare our new observations to sporadic metabolic rates reported over the previous 50 years on the same reef flat. Gnet and Pnet estimates at the nearshore site were 50% and 166% lower than an offshore site with a shift in organic production from net productive to net respiratory. Contrary to expectations, calcification rates in 2017 were comparable to the 1970\u2019s estimate and 400% greater than similar observations in 2014. Our results indicate only weak associations between Gnet and aragonite (\u03a9ar). A local increase in coral cover from 18% in 2014 to 31% in 2017 was the likely driver of increased calcification. A steeper TA \u2013 DIC slope in 2017 demonstrates a greater control of calcification on seawater carbonate chemistry than prior years. Overall, these results highlight the importance of site selection and replication when comparing metabolic datasets, and demonstrate major short-term variability in metabolic rates.

Prestressing the CRFP laminate prior to attaching them to a steel beam can delay the common premature debonding, which is the predominant failure mode when loading such composite elements in flexure. Following a previously published experimental investigation, this paper presents the results of a finite element simulation of steel I-beams strengthened with bonded and mechanically anchored prestressed CFRP laminate subjected to flexural loading. The numerical analysis adopts a Cohesive Zone Model (CZM) technique to simulate the separation between the CFRP laminate and the steel beam in order to model the debonding failure mode. The accuracy of the finite element model is verified by comparing its results to those of the previously published experimental investigation, which was carried out on steel I-beams strengthened with prestressed CFRP laminate in deferent configurations. The numerical model is then used to evaluate the effect of changing the level of the prestressing force on the strengthened beams performance. It is found that the CFRP prestressing enhances the yield and ultimate load carrying capacity of the beams and delays the typical premature debonding failure up to a certain level of laminate prestressing.", "DOI": "10.56748/ejse.16210", "len_ids": "151-469-231-245-958", "time": [2022, 8, 18], "source": "question/lens", "label": "Yes.", "answer": "yes"}

{"title": "Low-intensity focused ultrasound neuromodulation for stroke recovery: A novel deep brain stimulation approach for neurorehabilitation?", "abstract": "Stroke as the leading cause of adult long-term disability and has a significant impact on patients, society and socio-economics. Non-invasive brain stimulation (NIBS) approaches such as transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) or transcranial electrical stimulation (tES) are considered as potential therapeutic options to enhance functional reorganization and augment the effects of neurorehabilitation. However, non-invasive electrical and magnetic stimulation paradigms are limited by their depth focality trade-off function that does not allow to target deep key brain structures critically important for recovery processes. Transcranial ultrasound stimulation (TUS) is an emerging approach for non-invasive deep brain neuromodulation. Using non-ionizing, ultrasonic waves with millimeter-accuracy spatial resolution, excellent steering capacity and long penetration depth, TUS has the potential to serve as a novel non-invasive deep brain stimulation method to establish unprecedented neuromodulation and novel neurorehabilitation protocols. The purpose of the present review is to provide an overview on the current knowledge about the neuromodulatory effects of TUS while discussing the potential of TUS in the field of stroke recovery, with respect to existing NIBS methods.

Since bioactive biomaterials are more strongly integrated than inert ones (e.g. titanium or alumina), and since osseointegration is a word implying strong bonding, we propose to devote, the use of the concept of osseointegration for materials which are most successfully integrated into bone, i.e. when the bone/implant interface is a diffuse interface with full chemical bonding, such as for bioactive biomaterials. If the bonelimplant interface is a sharp one, the concept of osseointegration is no longer relevant and we propose use of the term \u2018osteal integration\u2019, i. e. for inert biomaterials, such as titanium and alumina.

The energy needed to produce the required relativistic flow in the GRB is consequently reduced, in some cases by orders of magnitude.

{"title": "Similarities and Differences between Coronal Holes and the Quiet Sun: Are Loop Statistics the Key?", "abstract": "Coronal holes (CH) emit significantly less at coronal temperatures than quiet-Sun regions (QS), but can hardly be distinguished in most chromospheric and lower transition region lines. A key quantity for the understanding of this phenomenon is the magnetic field. We use data from SOHO/MDI to reconstruct the magnetic field in coronal holes and the quiet Sun with the help of a potential magnetic model. Starting from a regular grid on the solar surface we then trace field lines, which provide the overall geometry of the 3D magnetic field structure. We distinguish between open and closed field lines, with the closed field lines being assumed to represent magnetic loops. We then try to compute some properties of coronal loops. The loops in the coronal holes (CH) are found to be on average flatter than in the QS. High and long closed loops are extremely rare, whereas short and low-lying loops are almost as abundant in coronal holes as in the quiet Sun. When interpreted in the light of loop scaling laws this result suggests an explanation for the relatively strong chromospheric and transition region emission (many low-lying, short loops), but the weak coronal emission (few high and long loops) in coronal holes. In spite of this contrast our calculations also suggest that a significant fraction of the cool emission in CHs comes from the open flux regions. Despite these insights provided by the magnetic field line statistics further work is needed to obtain a definite answer to the question if loop statistics explain the differences between coronal holes and the quiet Sun.", "DOI": "10.1007/s11207-004-3747-2", "source": "arxiv", "time": [2009, 6, 25], "label": "Yes.", "answer": "yes"}

For example, the well-known lectin, galectin-3, a lactose-binding protein, can act inside the nucleus in splicing events, and at the plasma membrane in adhesion, and it was demonstrated that galectin-3 interacts in the cytoplasm with Bcl-2, an antiapoptotic protein. Some years ago, our group isolated a nuclear lectin CBP70, capable of recognizing N-acetylglucosamine residues. This lectin, first isolated from the nucleus of HL60 cells, was also localized in the cytoplasm. It has been demonstrated that CBP70 is a glycosylated lectin, with different types of glycosylation, comparing cytoplasmic and nuclear forms. In this article, we have studied the localization of CBP70 in undifferentiated HL60 cells by electron microscopy, immunofluorescence analysis, and subcellular fractionation. The results obtained clearly demonstrated that CBP70 is a plurilocalized lectin that is found in the nucleus, at the endoplasmic reticulum, the Golgi apparatus, and mitochondria, but not at the plasma membrane.

{"title": "Are Schools Alienating Digitally Engaged Students? : Longitudinal Relations between Digital Engagement and School Engagement", "abstract": "This article examined digital learning engagement as the out-of-school learning component that reflects informally emerging socio-digital participation. The gap hypothesis proposes that students who prefer learning with digital technologies outside of school are less engaged in traditional school. This hypothesis was approached from the framework of connected learning, referring to the process of connecting self-regulated and interest-driven learning across formal and informal contexts. We tested this hypothesis with longitudinal data. It was of interest how digital engagement, operationalized as a general digital learning preference, wish for digital schoolwork, and their interaction, is related to traditional school engagement. This was examined both cross-sectionally in three time points and longitudinally across three years. The participants were 1,705 (43.7% female) 7th\u20139th graders (13-15 years old) from 27 schools in Helsinki, Finland. We explored the structure of correlations between latent constructs at each time point separately, and finally, to evaluate longitudinal relations between digital engagement and school engagement we specified latent cross-lagged panel models. The results indicate that students holding a stronger general digital learning preference experienced higher schoolwork engagement, both contemporaneously and over time, indicating successful connected learning. However, the results also showed support for the gap hypothesis: Students who preferred digital learning but did not have the chance to digitally engage at school, experienced a decrease in school engagement over time.

Therefore, they are interesting for industrial use, although their price is high. The principle of the resistive fault current limiter is based on the steep current-voltage characteristic of superconductors. When the current rises over the critical one, voltage on the superconductor rises steeply, and this mechanism blocks the increase of the current. Simultaneous appearance of voltage and current during this limiting period of operation generates a substantial amount of heat that is dissipated in the superconducting wire causing a rapid increase of its temperature. In this contribution, we further develop the idea that, during a limiting period, there is only a small difference between cooling by liquid nitrogen and adiabatic conditions. Using this approach, one can think about a current limiter free from a liquid coolant using a cryocooler. In this contribution, we discuss main differences in cooling conditions and test the idea on a short sample of the high-temperature superconductor REBCO conductor. We compare the behavior of identical samples cooled to the same temperature by liquid nitrogen and conduction cooled.

Detailed interpretations of various spectroscopic constants on the basis of simple models yielded a range of properties of the complex.

The changes in the nuclear quadrupole coupling constants on complex formation lead to the conclusion that a fraction \u03b4i=0.021(4) of an electron is transferred from N to I while the polarisation of the ICl subunit by the HCN subunit, and viceversa, can be expressed in terms of transfers of fractions \u03b4p(Cl)=0.075(1) and \u03b4p(N)=0.07(2) of electrons within ICl and HCN to Cl and N, respectively.

{"title": "Adsorbed xenon propellant storage: are nanoporous materials worth the weight?", "abstract": "Xenon is used as a propellant for spacecraft. Conventionally, xenon is compressed to high pressures (75\u2013300 bar) for bulk storage onboard the spacecraft. An adsorbed xenon storage system based on nanoporous materials (NPMs) could, potentially, (i) reduce the storage pressures, (ii) allow for thinner-walled and lighter pressure vessels, and (iii) if the NPM itself is sufficiently light, reduce the overall mass of the storage system and, thus, of the payload of the rocket launch. To investigate, we develop a simple mathematical model of an adsorbed xenon storage system by coupling a mechanical model for the pressure vessel and a thermodynamic model for the density of xenon adsorbed in the NPM. From the model, we derive the optimal storage pressure, tailored to each NPM, with the objective of minimizing the mass of the materials required to store the xenon. The model enables us to: (i) rank NPMs for adsorbed xenon propellant storage, (ii) compare adsorbed storage to the baseline of bulk storage, and (iii) understand what properties of NPMs are desirable for adsorbed xenon propellant storage. We use the model to evaluate several NPMs, mostly metal\u2013organic frameworks (MOFs), for adsorbed xenon propellant storage at room temperature, using experimental xenon adsorption data as input. We find Ni-MOF-74 and MOF-505 outperform activated carbon, a traditional adsorbent. However, each optimized adsorbed xenon storage system is heavier than the optimized bulk storage system, owing dominantly to the large mass of the NPM itself. To provide a lighter adsorbed xenon storage system than a bulk storage system, our model suggests to pursue light adsorbents with a high gravimetric saturation loading of xenon.", "DOI": "10.1039/d1ma00167a", "len_ids": "107-671-771-586-685", "time": [2021, 3, 4], "source": "question/lens", "label": "Yes.", "answer": "yes"}

This calls for exploring newer diagnostic and therapeutic options with minimal side effects. Curcumin is an established anti-endometriotic agent with inherent fluorescent properties; however, poor bioavailability limits its clinical utility. To address this shortcoming, various transition metals were conjugated with curcumin to improve its stability, specificity and pharmacological properties. The chemical stability, hemocompatibility and ability of the synthesized metallo-curcumin complexes (MCCs) to ameliorate endometriotic lesions were investigated. While all of the MCCs exhibited low hemolytic activity, their chemical and biological activities were largely dependent on the nature of the metal ion conjugated to the curcumin molecule.

Examined were whether the common pest Lepidoptera of the USA and Canada are generalists or specialists, the successional stage occupied by plants upon which alternative hosts of their hymenopteran parasitoids are found . Forty-two species of native North American pest Lepidoptera in eight families were examined. Lepidoptera were mainly polyphagous feeders. Most of the hymenopteran (53%) and tachinid (72%) parasitoids associated with the Lepidoptera were generalists. Food plant range was determined for 90% of the 649 alternate hosts identified. A majority fed either exclusively on trees (33.3%) or exclusively on ruderal species (29.9%). Half the alternate hosts (50.7%) feed at least sometimes on late successional species.

Tachinid generalist and oligophagous parasitoids were associated strongly with lepidopteran alternate hosts (48 and 71%, respectively) that feed exclusively on trees and shrubs.

Disruption of lipid homeostasis can promote pathological changes that contribute towards biological ageing and age-related diseases. Several age-related diseases have been associated with altered lipid metabolism and an elevation in highly damaging lipid peroxidation products; the latter has been ascribed, at least in part, to mitochondrial dysfunction and elevated ROS formation. In addition, senescent cells, which are known to contribute significantly to age-related pathologies, are also associated with impaired mitochondrial function and changes in lipid metabolism. Therapeutic targeting of dysfunctional mitochondrial and pathological lipid metabolism is an emerging strategy for alleviating their negative impact during ageing and the progression to age-related diseases. Such therapies could include the use of drugs that prevent mitochondrial uncoupling, inhibit inflammatory lipid synthesis, modulate lipid transport or storage, reduce mitochondrial oxidative stress and eliminate senescent cells from tissues.

{"title": "Reaction of the m-THPC triplet state with the antioxidant Trolox and the anesthetic Propofol: Modulation of photosensitization mechanisms relevant to photodynamic therapy?", "abstract": "Antioxidants may affect the outcome of photodynamic therapy (PDT) through the inactivation of reactive oxygen species. Their direct interaction with photosensitizers excited at the triplet state is also worthy of interest. This process is investigated by laser flash photolysis of m-THPC (meso-tetra(3-hydroxyphenyl)chlorin, Foscan) hydroalcoholic solutions added with Trolox (TrOH), a standard antioxidant or Propofol (PfOH, Diprivan(\u00ae)), a common anesthetic agent also characterized for its antioxidant properties. Transient UV-visible absorption spectra, kinetics at selected wavelengths and final spectra after extensive laser irradiation show that both compounds react with the m-THPC triplet state, (3)m-THPC, to ultimately restore the photosensitizer in its ground state. For PfOH, this process mainly appears as a single step obeying pseudo-first order kinetics. The bimolecular rate constant for the quenching of (3)m-THPC by PfOH is around 2 \u00d7 10(6) M(-1) s(-1), a value increased to some extent by the water content of the solution. A bimolecular reaction between (3)m-THPC and TrOH is observed with a rate constant of similar magnitude and dependence upon water. However, the reaction leads, at least partly, to intermediate species assigned to the TrO\u02d9 radical and the m-THPC anion radical. Within a few ms, these species back react to yield m-THPC in its ground state. A general mechanism involving an intermediate activated complex with some charge transfer character is proposed. Depending on the redox potentials for the oxidation of the antioxidant, this complex evolves predominantly either toward the formation of radicals (TrOH) or back to the photosensitizer ground state (PfOH).

{"title": "Towards a Correlation of Absolute Configuration and Chiroptical Properties of Alkyl Aryl Sulfoxides: A Coupled\u2010Oscillator Foundation of the Empirical Mislow Rule?", "abstract": "The absorption and circular dichroism (CD) data for a series of alkyl aryl sulfoxides 1-16 of known S configuration have been analyzed. The strong bathochromic effect exerted by the nitro group in the para position of the phenyl sulfoxides indicates that the sulfur atom acts as an electron donor moiety towards the phenyl ring. Such behavior requires a significant 2p(C)-3sp3(S) overlap, and therefore the phenyl (and p-substituted phenyl) sulfoxides 1-12, as well as the 2-naphthyl sulfoxides 15 and 16, must assume a conformation which permits such orbital overlap. The steric effect of the peri hydrogen in 1-naphthyl-substituted compounds 13 and 14 does not allow a conformation of this type, and in these compounds the above-mentioned 2p(C) and 3sp3(S) orbitals are positioned in almost orthogonal planes. This conformational difference is clearly shown by the absorption spectra: compounds 1-12, 15, and 16 show the lowest energy sigma --> sigma* transition of the sulfoxide chromophore at approximately 250 nm, indicating the existence of a conjugated S=O chromophore. In contrast, the corresponding absorption in 13 and 14 occurs at about 200 nm, indicating the presence of an isolated S=O chromophore. The CD spectra of 13 and 14 show a negative, couplet-like feature between 250 and 200 nm. This spectral feature can be interpreted in terms of exciton coupling between the allowed sigma --> sigma* transition of the isolated S=O chromophore at 200 nm and the 1B transition of the naphthalene chromophore. In fact, the Harada-Nakanishi rule predicts a negative CD couplet for an S-configured sulfoxide in the conformation found by UV analysis, as found experimentally. The CD spectrum of 13 is quantitatively reproduced by DeVoe coupled-oscillator calculations, strongly implying that a coupled-oscillator mechanism is operative in determining the optical activity of 13 and 14. This approach has also tentatively been extended to the conjugated sulfoxides 1-12, taking into account the coupling of the benzene chromophore 1La transition with the sigma --> sigma* transition of the S=O chromophore. In this case the Harada-Nakanishi rule also predicts a negative CD couplet for the S-configured sulfoxides, as found experimentally.", "DOI": "10.1002/1521-3765(20010105)7:1<72::aid-chem72>3.0.co;2-1", "len_ids": "008-223-742-799-122", "time": [2018, 5, 8], "source": "question/lens", "label": "Yes.", "answer": "yes"}

We suggest here the fifth-force mediated by a coupled Dark Energy (cDE) as a possible velocity-enhancing mechanism and investigate its effect on the infall velocities of the bullet-like systems from the CoDECS (COupled Dark Energy Cosmological Simulations) public database. Five different cDE models are considered: three with constant coupling and exponential potential, one with exponential coupling and exponential potential, and one with constant coupling and supergravity potential. For each model, after identifying the bullet-like systems, we determine the probability density distribution of their infall velocities at the pair separations of (2-3)R_{vir}. Approximating each probability density distribution as a Gaussian, we calculate the cumulative probability of finding a bullet-like system with V_{c}>=3000 km/s or V_{c}>=2500 km/s. Our results show that in all of the five cDE models the cumulative probabilities increase compared to the \\Lambda CDM case and that in the model with exponential coupling P(V_{c}>=2500 km/s) exceeds 10^{-4}.

We also examine the gyroid structure, which was recently suggested as a different type of nuclear pasta by analogy with the polymer systems. The gyroid structure investigated in this paper is approximately formulated as an extension of the periodic minimal surface whose mean curvature vanishes. In contrast to our expectations, we find from the present approximate formulation that the curvature corrections act to slightly disfavor the appearance of the gyroid structure.

The goal of this study was to determine the ability of HSI and image segmentation to discriminate burn wounds in a preclinical porcine model. A heated brass rod was used to introduce burn wounds of graded severity in a pig model and a sequence of hyperspectral data was recorded up to 8-h postinjury. The hyperspectral images were processed by an unsupervised spectral\u2013spatial segmentation algorithm. Segmentation was validated using results from histology. The proposed algorithm was compared to K-means segmentation and was found superior. The obtained segmentation maps revealed separated zones within the burn sites, indicating a variation in burn severity. The suggested image-processing scheme allowed mapping dynamic changes of spectral properties within the burn wounds over time. The results of this study indicate that unsupervised spectral\u2013spatial segmentation applied on hyperspectral images can discriminate burn injuries of varying severity.", "DOI": "10.1117/1.jbo.21.10.101413", "len_ids": "135-082-412-086-89X", "time": [2018, 5, 12], "source": "question/lens", "label": "Yes.", "answer": "yes"}

IRAS 13224-3809 is the most variable bright AGN in the X-ray sky and shows strong X-ray reflection, implying that the X-rays strongly illuminate the inner disc. Therefore, it is a good candidate to study the relationship between coronal X-ray and disc UV emission. However, we find no correlation between the X-ray and UV flux over the available ~40 day monitoring, despite the presence of strong X-ray variability and the variable part of the UV spectrum being consistent with irradiation of a standard thin disc. This means either that the X-ray flux which irradiates the UV emitting outer disc does not correlate with the X-ray flux in our line of sight and/or that another process drives the majority of the UV variability. The former case may be due to changes in coronal geometry, absorption or scattering between the corona and the disc.", "DOI": "10.1093/mnras/sty008", "source": "arxiv", "time": [2018, 2, 14], "label": "Yes.", "answer": "no"}
{"title": "Are fossil groups early-forming galaxy systems?", "abstract": "Using the Illustris cosmological simulation, we investigate the origin of fossil groups in the $M_{200}=10^{13}-10^{13.5}M_{\\odot}/h$ mass regime. We examine the formation of the two primary features of fossil groups: the large magnitude gap between their two brightest galaxies, and their exceptionally luminous brightest group galaxy (BGG). For fossils and non-fossils identified at $z=0$, we find no difference in their halo mass assembly at early times, departing from previous studies. However, we do find a significant difference in the recent accretion history of fossil and non-fossil halos; in particular, fossil groups show a lack of recent accretion and have in majority assembled 80\\% of their $M_{200}(z=0)$ mass before $z\\sim 0.4$. For fossils, massive satellite galaxies accreted during this period have enough time to merge with the BGG by the present day, producing a more massive central galaxy; and, the lack of recent group accretion prevents replenishment of the bright satellite population, allowing for a large magnitude gap to develop within the past few Gyr. We thus find that the origin of the magnitude gap and overmassive BGG of fossils in Illustris depends on the recent accretion history of the groups and merger history of the BGG after their collapse at $z\\sim1$. This indicates that selecting galaxy groups by their magnitude gap does not guarantee obtaining neither early-forming galaxy systems nor undisturbed central galaxies.", "DOI": "10.3847/1538-4357/aa7b88", "source": "arxiv", "time": [2017, 8, 23], "label": "Yes.", "answer": "no"}

The organophosphate pesticide pirimiphos-methyl (PM) is one of the novel contaminants that is most prevalent in commercial salmon feed. In this study, the feed-to-fillet transfer of dietary PM and its main metabolites was investigated in Atlantic salmon fillet. Based on the experimental determined PM and metabolite uptake, metabolisation, and elimination kinetics, a physiologically based toxicokinetic (PBTK) compartmental model was developed. Fish fed PM had a relatively low (~4%) PM retention and two main metabolites (2-DAMP and Desethyl-PM) were identified in liver, muscle, kidney and bile. The absence of more metabolised forms of 2-DAMP and Desethyl-PM in Atlantic salmon indicates different metabolism in cold-water fish compared to previous studies on ruminants. The model was used to simulate the long term (>1.5 years) feed-to-fillet transfer of PM + metabolite in Atlantic salmon under realistic farming conditions including seasonal fluctuations in feed intake, growth, and fat deposition in muscle tissue. The model predictions show that with the constant presence of the highest observed PM concentration in commercial salmon feed, fillet PM+ metabolite levels were approximately 5 nmol kg-1, with highest levels for the metabolite 2-DAMP. No EU maximum residue levels (MRL) for PM and its main metabolites exist in seafood to date, but the predicted levels were lower than the MRL for PM in swine of 32.7 nmol kg-1.", "DOI": "10.1080/19440049.2020.1829717", "len_ids": "049-653-005-687-160", "time": [2020, 10, 22], "source": "question/lens", "label": "Yes.", "answer": "no"}

{"title": "Does \"butyrylization\" of acetylcholinesterase through substitution of the six divergent aromatic amino acids in the active center gorge generate an enzyme mimic of butyrylcholinesterase?", "abstract": "The active center gorge of human acetylcholinesterase (HuAChE) is lined by 14 aromatic residues, whereas in the closely related human butyrylcholinesterase (HuBChE) 3 of the aromatic active center residues (Phe295, Phe297, Tyr337) as well as 3 of the residues at the gorge entrance (Tyr72, Tyr124, Trp286) are replaced by aliphatic amino acids. To investigate whether this structural variability can account for the reactivity differences between the two enzymes, gradual replacement of up to all of the 6 aromatic residues in HuAChE by the corresponding residues in HuBChE was carried out. The affinities of the hexamutant (Y72N/Y124Q/W286A/F295L/F297V/Y337A) toward tacrine, decamethonium, edrophonium, huperzine A, or BW284C51 differed by about 5-, 80-, 170-, 25000-, and 17000-fold, respectively, from those of the wild-type HuAChE. For most of these prototypical noncovalent active center and peripheral site ligands, the hexamutant HuAChE displayed a reactivity phenotype closely resembling that of HuBChE. These results support the accepted view that the active center architectures of AChE and BChE differ mainly by the presence of a larger void space in BChE. Nevertheless, reactivity of the hexamutant HuAChE toward the substrates acetylthiocholine and butyrylthiocholine, or covalent ligands such as phosphonates and the transition state analogue m-(N,N,N-trimethylammonio)trifluoroacetophenone (TMTFA), is about 45-170-fold lower than that of HuBChE. Most of this reduction in reactivity can be related to the combined replacements of the three aromatic residues at the active center, Phe295, Phe297, and Tyr337. We propose that the hexamutant HuAChE, unlike BChE, is impaired in its capacity to accommodate certain tetrahedral species in the active center. This impairment may be related to the enhanced mobility of the catalytic histidine His447, which is observed in molecular dynamics simulations of the hexamutant and the F295L/F297V/Y337A HuAChE enzymes but not in the wild-type HuAChE.", "DOI": "10.1021/bi010181x", "len_ids": "012-186-553-710-592", "time": [2018, 5, 8], "source": "1search_engine/lens", "label": "Yes.", "answer": "yes"}

Bacterial inactivation mediated by Ag-PES was seen to be completed within 60 min. The samples were prepared by high-power impulse magnetron sputtering (HiPIMS) at different sputter powers. In anaerobic media, this process required 120 min. The amounts of ions (Ar+, Ag+, and Ag2+) generated during the deposition by direct current magnetron sputtering (DCMS) and HiPIMS were determined by mass spectrometry. The thickness of the Ag films sputtered on PES by DCMS (0.28 A) during 100 s was found to be 340 nm. Thicknesses of 250, 230, and 200 nm were found when sputtering with HiPIMS was tuned at 8, 17, and 30 A, respectively. By scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM-HAADF), the atomic distribution of Ag and oxygen was detected. By X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), a shift in the Ag oxidation state was observed within the bacterial inactivation period.

{"title": "Do diamond-inclusion ages date only the protolith, not the diamond formation? : : commentary", "abstract": "THE ABILITY READILY TO ANNEAL AWAY defects in flawed diamonds to yield gem-stones of quality has consequences for more than their commercial marketing. A further implication concerns the age of the diamonds themselves. The carbon cannot be dated, but the inclusions or impurities within the crystal lattice can be. This has left unresolved the question of whether or not the diamond is simply this winter's ice covering a minute sample of the ancient rocks that first formed the Earth. The internal compositional disequilibrium in both the diamond and its inclusions can often be annealed out or expelled in a period from seconds to hours in the laboratory. Why should this disequilibrium prevail at depth in the Earth for billions of years, as is claimed, at temperatures and pressures at which the diamonds formed? The state of disequilibrium implies that the diamonds are of the same age as the kimberlite pipes in which they are hosted at the Earth's surface. Kimberlite pipes are formed by explosive volcanism. Synthetic diamonds are formed under explosive shock, as described by the reverse Boudouard reaction: 2CO \u2192 CO 2 + C(diamond) in the presence of metallic catalysts. This suggests that the same environment may attend exploding kimberlite magmas, which are required to generate similar pressures in order to break out and muck chimneys, which can be over two kilometres deep and more than half a kilometre across at the top. Although the arguments for geologically old diamonds have intellectual appeal, scrutiny indicates that these arguments are not conclusive, which is reason for exploring the possibility that diamonds may in fact be relatively young.

In addition, ChCl:EG at the known ethaline DES composition (1:2) and 1:20 molar ratio were studied on Au and Pt electrodes, and compared to glyceline (ChCl:glycerol, 1:2). The capacitance-potential curves on glassy carbon were best interpreted by the modified Gouy-Chapman model. A dampened U-shape was observed similar to dilute electrolytes, however, the non-negligible ionic and H-bonding interactions in these electrolytes resulted in ambiguity about the point of zero charge where capacitance was weakly dependent on potential. Additionally, the differential capacitance was independent of composition on glassy carbon due to limited availability of mobile free ions and constraints by solvated ion sizes within the interface. Increases in capacitance are observed with Au as a result of desolvation and specific adsorption of Cl, and with Pt upon decreased Cl concentrations. These results indicate DESs and H-bonded electrolytes with high salt concentrations are distinct from ionic liquids and present no pronounced overscreening or crowding with applied potential.", "DOI": "10.1149/1945-7111/abde83", "len_ids": "004-960-414-055-612", "time": [2021, 1, 23], "source": "question/lens", "label": "Yes.", "answer": "no"}
{"title": "Does excess iron play a role in breast carcinogenesis? An unresolved hypothesis.", "abstract": "Free iron is a pro-oxidant and can induce oxidative stress and DNA damage. The carcinogenicity of iron has been demonstrated in animal models, and epidemiologic studies have shown associations with several human cancers. However, a possible role of excess body iron stores or of elevated iron intake in breast carcinogenesis has received little attention epidemiologically. We propose that iron overload and the disruption of iron homeostasis with a resulting increase in free iron may contribute to the development of breast cancer, and we summarize the relevant evidence from mechanistic studies, animal experiments, and studies in humans. Over time a high intake of iron can lead to iron overload. Furthermore, body iron stores increase in women following menopause. Reactive oxygen species produced by normal aerobic cellular metabolism can lead to the release of free iron from ferritin. In the presence of superoxide radical and hydrogen peroxide, stored ferric iron (Fe(3+)) is reduced to ferrous iron (Fe(2+)), which catalyzes the formation of the hydroxyl radical (*OH). *OH in turn can promote lipid peroxidation, mutagenesis, DNA strand breaks, oncogene activation, and tumor suppressor inhibition, increasing the risk of breast cancer. In addition to its independent role as a proxidant, high levels of free iron may potentiate the effects of estradiol, ethanol, and ionizing radiation - three established risk factors for breast cancer. In order to identify the role of iron in breast carcinogenesis, improved biomarkers of body iron stores are needed, as are cohort studies which assess heme iron intake. Ultimately, it is important to determine whether iron levels in the breast and iron-induced pathology are higher in women who go on to develop breast cancer compared to women who do not.", "DOI": "10.1007/s10552-007-9058-9", "len_ids": "059-099-347-456-925", "time": [2018, 5, 12], "source": "1search_engine/lens", "label": "Yes.", "answer": "yes"}

By systematically sampling the potential energy surface of crystalline tetracene, we assess how the number, energy and structure of its minima are modified by switching on (or off) the Coulombic interactions. The increased complexity of the Coulombic potential leads to a more \"rugged\" potential energy surface with a larger number of minima, but the effect is not large. In fact, we find a subset of minima stable only in presence of the Coulombic interactions, a smaller subset stable only in their absence, and a large majority stable in both cases. Among these, there is a very good, but not perfect, correlation between the energies and the structures computed with and without the electrostatic interactions. Although electrostatic interactions play a role even in a rigid nonpolar molecule such as tetracene, they are not as crucial as often believed, because altering the electrostatic model (or switching it off completely) leads, in most cases, to equivalent results.", "DOI": "10.1021/jp710273r", "len_ids": "021-481-457-029-201", "time": [2018, 5, 11], "source": "question/lens", "label": "Yes.", "answer": "no"}

Intrinsic kinetic parameters of lipases in ester hydrolysis and formation in various organic solvents", "abstract": "When it is assumed that organic solvents do not interfere with the binding process nor with the catalytic mechanism, the contribution of substrate-solvent interactions to enzyme kinetics can be accounted for by just replacing substrate concentrations in the equations by thermodynamic activities. It appears from the transformation that only the affinity parameters (K(m), K(sp)) are affected by this. Thus, in theory, the values of these corrected, intrinsic parameters (K(m) (int), k(sp) (int)) and the maximal rate (V(1)) should be equal for all media. This was tested for hydrolysis, transesterification, and esterification reactions catalyzed by pig pancreas lipase and Pseudomonas cepacia lipase in various organic solvents. Correction was carried out via experimentally determined activity coefficients for the substrates in these solvents or, if not feasible, from values in data bases. However, although the kinetic performances of each enzyme in the solvents became much more similar after correction, differences still remained. Analysis of the enzyme suspensions revealed massive particles, which explains the low activity of enzymes in organic solvents. However, no correlation was found between estimates of the amount of catalytically available enzyme and the maximal rates observed. Moreover, the solvents had similar effects on the intrinsic parameters of suspended and immobilized enzyme. The possible causes for the effects of the solvents on the catalytic performance of the enzymes, remaining after correction for solvent-substrate interactions and the amount of participating enzyme, are discussed with respect to the premises on which the correction method is based.

Seven cave beetles were sampled seasonally from five Romanian caves together with a sampling of sediments and climatic measurements. Gut was extracted from the sampled specimens, and Illumina's 16S amplicon-based metagenomics sequencing protocol was applied to identify the gut microbiome. About 50% of the most abundant bacteria genera in the studied sediments are unknown taxa. The core elements of the sediments' microbiome were wb1-P19, Pseudomonas, and Lysobacter, all producers and decomposers of organic matter. Only Acinetobacter was shared for sediments and all cave beetles. The core bacteria in the gut of Leiodidae beetles of all five species were Vagococcus, Dysgonomonas, Candidatus Soleaferrea, and two unknown phylotypes. The cave Carabidae gut was dominated by Carnobacterium in one species and Enhydrobacter in the other, showing different food regimes within the Duvalius genus. Vagococcus was present in the gut microbiome of Leptodirini and Duvalius, a genus which might be involved in adaptation to life in caves, where food is scarce and autochthonous productivity is low.

Grape polyphenols exert antiglycative and antioxidant effects which may contribute to prevent chronic diseases. However, clinical evidence of grape polyphenols on chronic disease prevention and treatment by glycation markers modulation are limited. Therefore, we aimed to critically analyze studies about that topic to investigate the antiglycative power of dietary grape polyphenol, and to explore the molecular mechanism involved. This systematic review was conducted and reported according to PRISMA guidelines. The following search terms were used: \"grape\", \"extract\", \"grape seed extract\", \"grape skin extract\", \"polyphenol extract\", \"grape polyphenol(s)\", \"grape juice\", \"resveratrol\", \"quercetin\", \"catechin\", \"epicatechin\", \"procyanidin(s)\", and \"anthocyanin(s)\". Seven studies were included. Glycated hemoglobin was not affected. The interventions duration may not have been enough to detect changes. Grape polyphenols reduced fructosamine and methylglyoxal (MGO) concentrations, and increased endogenous secretory RAGE (esRAGE) gene expression but did not affect the serum concentration. Resveratrol antiglycative effects are mainly due its ability to trap MGO and downregulate RAGE. In conclusion, grape polyphenols may have a positive impact on early glycation products, AGEs and esRAGE.

{"title": "Laurate Biosensors Image Brain Neurotransmitters In Vivo: Can an Antihypertensive Medication Alter Psychostimulant Behavior?", "abstract": "Neuromolecular Imaging (NMI) with novel biosensors enables the selective detection of neurotransmitters in vivo within seconds, on line and in real time. Biosensors remain in place for continuing studies over a period of months. This biotechnological advance is based on conventional electrochemistry; the biosensors detect neurotransmitters by electron transfer. Simply stated, biosensors adsorb electrons from each neurotransmitter at specific oxidation potentials; the current derived from electron transfer is proportional to neurotransmitter concentration. Selective electron transfer properties of these biosensors permit the imaging of neurotransmitters, metabolites and precursors. The novel BRODERICK PROBE\u00ae biosensors we have developed, differ in formulation and detection capabilities from biosensors/electrodes used in conventional electrochemistry/ voltammetry. In these studies, NMI, specifically, the BRODERICK PROBE\u00ae laurate biosensor images neurotransmitter signals within mesolimbic neuronal terminals, nucleus accumbens (NAc); dopamine (DA), serotonin (5-HT), homovanillic acid (HVA) and Ltryptophan (L-TP) are selectively imaged. Simultaneously, we use infrared photobeams to monitor open-field movement behaviors on line with NMI in the same animal subjects. The goals are to investigate integrated neurochemical and behavioral effects of cocaine and caffeine alone and co-administered and further, to use ketanserin to decipher receptor profiles for these psychostimulants, alone and co-administered. The rationale for selecting this medication is: ketanserin (a) is an antihypertensive and cocaine and caffeine produce hypertension and (b) acts at 5-HT2A/2C receptors, prevalent in NAc and implicated in hypertension and cocaine addiction. Key findings are: (a) the moderate dose of caffeine simultaneously potentiates cocaine's neurochemical and behavioral responses. (b) ketanserin simultaneously inhibits cocaine-increased DA and 5-HT release in NAc and open-field behaviors and (c) ketanserin inhibits 5-HT release in NAc and open-field behaviors produced by caffeine, but, surprisingly, acts to increase DA release in NAc. Importantly, the latter effect may be a possible adverse effect of the moderate dose of caffeine in hypertensive patients. Thus, an antihypertensive medication is shown here to play a role in inhibiting brain reward possibly via antihypertensive mechanisms at DA and 5-HT receptor subtypes within DA motor neurons. An explanatory note for the results obtained, is the role likely played by the G Protein Receptor Complex (GPRC) family of proteins. Empirical evidence shows that GPRC dimers, heteromers and heterotrimers may cause cross-talk between distinct signalling cascade pathways in the actions of cocaine and caffeine. Ligand-directed functional selectivity, particularly for ketanserin, in addition to GPRCs, may also cause differential responses. The results promise new therapeutic strategies for drug addiction, brain reward and cardiovascular medicine.", "DOI": "10.3390/s8074033", "len_ids": "036-011-562-668-628", "time": [2018, 5, 11], "source": "question/lens", "label": "Yes.", "answer": "yes"}

There does, however, appear to exist, disagreement amongst accreditation experts when considering single-operator laboratories. Some accreditation bodies accredit single-operator laboratories, whilst others require additional human resources prior to granting accreditation. This discrepancy leads to unfair competition amongst laboratories as a single-operator laboratory by definition needs less resources (both human and financial) to achieve and maintain accreditation, compared with a laboratory where additional human resources need to be sought prior to and in order to maintain accreditation.

{"title": "Another hormone-sensitive triglyceride lipase in fat cells?", "abstract": "The mobilization of fatty acid from triglycerides and cholesterol esters provides the primary source of energy in mammals. Hormone-sensitive lipase (HSL) is a multifunctional tissue lipase that plays a critical role in this process. The enzyme has broad specificity, catalyzing the hydrolysis of tri-, di-, and monoacylglycerols, as well as cholesterol esters. HSL has been studied most extensively in adipose tissue, where it is thought to catalyze the major rate-limiting step in lipolysis. The lipase is acutely activated by cAMP-dependent phosphorylation, which also leads to its redistribution from the cytoplasm to the lipid droplet (1, 2) (Fig. 1). Regulation of adipocyte HSL is the primary means by which lipolytic agents, such as catecholamines, stimulate the release of free fatty acids (FFAs) and thus control circulating levels. Plasma FFAs profoundly influence carbohydrate and lipid utilization, storage, and synthesis, both in liver and muscle. Moreover, fatty acids produced in fat cells can uncouple ATP synthesis, resulting in adaptive thermogenesis (3). Products of fatty acid metabolism are also thought to bind directly to nuclear receptors, thus regulating transcription of genes involved in lipid synthesis and breakdown (4). These observations predict HSL to be an important player in controlling the balance of substrate utilization and storage.", "DOI": "10.1073/pnas.97.2.535", "len_ids": "043-911-428-988-679", "time": [2018, 5, 8], "source": "1search_engine/lens", "label": "Yes.", "answer": "yes"}

One of the most widely used synthesis methods for rGO membranes is vacuum filtration of graphene oxide (GO) on a filter membrane, followed by reduction, which shows great advantages such as operational convenience and good controllability. Despite vacuum-filtrated rGO membranes being widely used in many applications, a fundamental question is overlooked: are the top and bottom surfaces of the membranes formed at the interfaces with air and with the filter membrane respectively symmetric or asymmetric? This work, for the first time, reports the asymmetry of the vacuum-filtrated rGO membranes and discloses the filter membranes\u2019 physical imprint on the bottom surface of the rGO membrane, which takes place when the filter membrane surface pores have similar dimension to GO sheets. This result points out that the asymmetric surface properties should be cautiously taken into consideration while designing the surface-related applications for GO and rGO membranes.", "source": "3cross_byjournal/rsc", "label": "Yes.", "answer": "no"}

Women with RPL show higher prevalence of undiagnosed gut disorders. Furthermore, in endometrial tissues of RPL women, higher expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines and Nalp-3 inflammasome has been observed. Aim of this study was to investigate whether an abnormal gut permeability might occur in RPL women and allow passage into systemic circulation of pro-inflammatory molecules able to induce endometrial inflammation. 70 women with idiopathic RPL and 30 healthy women were recruited at the Recurrent Pregnancy Loss Outpatient Unit of the Gemelli Hospital of Rome from March 2013 to February 2017. Enrolled women underwent 51Cr-ethylene-diamine-tetraacetic acid absorption test to evaluate intestinal permeability. Sera obtained from enrolled women were analysed for lipopolysaccharide (LPS) by ELISA. Anxiety and depression state were evaluated by administering STAI-Y and Zung-SDS tests, respectively. Of all recruited individuals, 35 women with idiopathic RPL and 20 healthy controls accepted to undergo diagnostic hysteroscopy and endometrial biopsy. Endometrial lysates were investigated for inflammasome Nalp-3 by Western blot analysis, and caspase-1, IL-1\u03b2 and IL-18 by ELISA, respectively. Higher prevalence of abnormal intestinal permeability (P\u2009<\u20090.0001), increased circulating levels of LPS (P\u2009<\u20090.05), anxiety (P\u2009<\u20090.05) and depression (P\u2009<\u20090.05) were observed in RLP women compared to controls. Endometrial expression of Nalp-3, caspase-1 and IL-1\u03b2 was significantly increased in RPL group . IL-18 endometrial levels were not found to be higher in RPL cases. Statistically significant association between higher intestinal permeability and abnormally increased expression of endometrial Nalp-3, was observed in RPL (P\u2009<\u20090.01). Furthermore, higher LPS serum levels, a bacterial-derived activator of Nalp-3 complex, was shown to be statistically associated to abnormal endometrial expression of Nalp-3 inflammasome (P\u2009<\u20090.01) in RPL women. In women with RLP, leaky gut might occur and allow passage into circulation of immune triggers, potentially able to elicit endometrial innate immune response and, thus, to contribute to miscarriage pathogenesis.

Linked data from the Nord-Trondelag Health Study and the Medical Birth Registry of Norway yielded 19,987 parous and 1,625 nulliparous women. Using mixed-effects spline models, we estimated differences in nonfasting lipid levels from before to after first birth in parous women and between parous and nulliparous women. HDL cholesterol (HDL-C) dropped by -4.2 mg/dl (95% CI: -5.0, -3.3) from before to after first birth in adjusted models, a 7% change, and the total cholesterol (TC) to HDL-C ratio increased by 0.18 (95% CI: 0.11, 0.25), with no change in non-HDL-C or triglycerides. Changes in HDL-C and the TC/HDL-C ratio associated with pregnancy persisted for decades, leading to altered life-course lipid trajectories. For example, parous women had a lower HDL-C than nulliparous women at the age of 50 years . Adverse changes in lipids were greatest after first birth, with small changes after subsequent births, and were larger in women who did not breastfeed. Findings suggest that pregnancy is associated with long-lasting adverse changes in HDL-C, potentially setting parous women on a more atherogenic trajectory than prior to pregnancy.", "DOI": "10.1194/jlr.p085720", "len_ids": "085-941-341-602-957", "time": [2018, 10, 29], "source": "7question/lens", "label": "Yes.", "answer": "yes"}

In this research, we empirically examined the hypotheses by fixed effect model with data of 30 provinces in China during 2008-2019. The result turns out that green finance has significantly positive effect on green innovation in all regions in China, and the effect is stronger in western and central regions than eastern region. Furthermore, we verified the effect of environmental regulations on green innovation, and the results show the effect is larger in eastern region than western and central regions. Additionally, with intense environmental regulations, the effect of green finance in promoting green innovation is enhanced in all regions. Our results thus contribute to unveil the mixed relationships among green finance, environmental regulations, and green innovation.

TP53 gene is mutated in more than 50% of human cancers, although its overall dysfunction may be even more frequent. TP53 mutations are detected in a lower percentage of hematological malignancies compared to solid tumors, but their frequency generally increases with disease progression, generating adverse effects such as resistance to chemotherapy. Due to the crucial role of P53 in therapy response, several molecules have been developed to re-establish the wild-type P53 function to mutant P53. PRIMA-1 and its methylated form PRIMA-1Met (also named APR246) are capable of restoring the wild-type conformation to mutant P53 and inducing apoptosis in cancer cells; however, they also possess mutant P53-independent properties.

The present article provides the first insight on the associated sponge fauna of the recently discovered CWC communities on the Catalan Margin and, to a lesser extent, the Cabliers Coral Mound Province, while also reviewing the current knowledge of the sponge fauna dwelling in all the Mediterranean CWC provinces. In regards to the studied areas, some rare species are cited for the first time in the Mediterranean or redescribed, while two of them, Hamacantha (Hamacantha) hortae sp. nov. and Spongosorites cabliersi sp. nov. are new to science. At a basin scale, Mediterranean CWC appear as poriferan biodiversity hotspots, yet current diversity values on each site rather represent a small fraction of its actual fauna. Additionally, the existence of an endemic sponge fauna exclusively dwelling on CWC is refuted. Nonetheless, the sponge fauna thriving in Mediterranean CWC appears to be unique, and different from that of other Atlantic regions. Finally, with the current knowledge, the sponge fauna from the Mediterranean CWC is grouped in three distinguishable clusters , which appears to be determined by the basins water circulation, specially the Levantine Intermediate Water and the Atlantic Water following a western-eastern pattern from the Strait of Gibraltar to the Adriatic Sea.

Oral dryness often occurs in the elderly due to the presence of systemic diseases and medications, which favors the development of many lesions and complaints, including dental caries, candidiasis, retention of full removable denture, taste disturbance and it enforces a change in nutrition. OBJECTIVES The aim of this study was to assess the impact of oral dryness on oral health-related quality of life in older subjects. MATERIAL AND METHODS Five hundred subjects of both genders, aged 65 and over (mean 74.4 \u00b17.4) were involved in the study. Oral dryness was evaluated clinically with use of the Challacombe scale (CODS, Clinical Oral Dryness Score). The oral health-related quality of life was assessed by the Oral Health Impact Profile scale (OHIP-14). RESULTS Oral dryness occurred in 32.8% of subjects, most often on a mild level (29.6%). The average value of the OHIP-14 scale was 8.01 \u00b113.59.

The remaining AO variability has been attributed to other little-known factors. A factor that has been associated with other neurodegenerative diseases is arterial hypertension (AHT). The aim of this study is to evaluate the contribution of AHT to the AO of HD. We used data from a cohort of 630 European HD patients with adult onset collected by the REGISTRY project of the European Huntington\u2019s Disease Network. Multiple linear regression and ANOVA, controlling for the CAG repeat number of the expanded allele (CAGexp) of each patient, were performed to assess the association between the AHT condition and the AO of the motor symptoms (mAO). The results showed a significant association between AHT and mAO, especially when we only considered the patients diagnosed with AHT prior to manifesting any HD signs (pre-HD AHT). Remarkably, despite the low number of cases, those patients developed motor symptoms 5\u20138 years later than normotensive patients in the most frequent CAGexp range (40\u201344). AHT is an age-related condition and consequently, the age of the patient at the time of data collection could be a confounder variable. However, given that most pre-HD AHT patients included in our study had started treatment with antihypertensive drugs prior to the onset of HD, and that antihypertensive drugs have been suggested to confer a neuroprotective effect in other neurodegenerative diseases, raises the interest in elucidating the impact of AHT and/or AHT treatment in HD age of onset in further studies. A confirmation of our results in a larger sample set would open the possibility to significantly improve HD management.", "DOI": "10.1371/journal.pone.0197975", "len_ids": "036-519-142-889-448", "time": [2018, 5, 25], "source": "7question/lens", "label": "Yes.", "answer": "yes"}

Some recent studies have indicated that white wine could also be as cardioprotective as red wine. The present investigation compares the cardioprotective abilities of red wine, white wine, and their principal cardioprotective constituents. Different groups of rats were gavaged with red wine, white wine, resveratrol, tyrosol, and hydroxytyrosol. Red wine and its constituent resveratrol and white wine and its constituents tyrosol and hydroxytyrosol all showed different degrees of cardioprotection as evidenced by their abilities to improve postischemic ventricular performance, reduce myocardial infarct size and cardiomyocyte apoptosis, and reduce peroxide formation. It was discovered in this study that although each of the wines and their components increased the enzymatic activities of the mitochondrial complex (I-IV) and citrate synthase, which play very important roles in oxidative phosphorylation and ATP synthesis, some of the groups were more complex-specific in inducing the activity compared to the other groups. Cardioprotective ability was further confirmed by increased expression of phospho-Akt, Bcl-2, eNOS, iNOS, COX-1, COX-2, Trx-1, Trx-2, and HO-1.

Despite the unknown inaccuracy of such calculations what regional distribution of material, lifetime or growth rates concerns highly valuable information can be generated to support the industrial business strategy.\u2029When particular products or metal applications in functional units become the scope of such calculations besides mass flow often energy consumption and emissions appear on the agenda. And, unfortunately, metals are recycled . At that point MFA crosses the border from being a static snapshot of an existing system towards a time depending life cycle approach. Besides volume, quality, and location time is introduced as a fourth dimension and the dilemma starts. In the past one approach was to develop depreciation models to allocate the expenditures of mining and primary metal production of Copper and Aluminium according to the recycled content. But latter is even more disputable since metal recycling cannot be treated as an alternative production route achieving the original properties and chemical composition. And, as a result of its electrochemical behavior, each metal cycle looks completely different compared to any other. Consequently the general acceptance of the existing allocation methods for recycling in life cycle models is still low.\u2029In case of Aluminium the historic primary metal production cumulates to an amount of almost 900 million tons worldwide. With the aid of recycling 75% of this material could be conserved in the current inventory in use. As this stock significantly contributes to todays and future's raw material supply the following question arises: Can metallic materials have a defined history and therewith an ecological hereditary debt, which will be reduced by further recycling cycles? If the answer would be yes, on a highly aggregated level, another more practical question would be whether such a credit should be based on the historic expenditures of primary production or better considering the future recycling potential of the inventory in use. In these cases recycling credits are either overestimated or underestimated depending on the lifetime and herewith the deviation from current End of Life recycling practices.", "DOI": "10.1051/metal/2009090", "len_ids": "078-606-370-662-279", "time": [2018, 5, 10], "source": "question/lens", "label": "Yes.", "answer": "yes"}
{"title": "Factors Influencing Epigenetic Mechanisms: Is There A Role for Bariatric Surgery?", "abstract": "Epigenetics is the interaction between the genome and environmental stimuli capable of influencing gene expression during development and aging. A large number of studies have shown that metabolic diseases are highly associated with epigenetic alterations, suggesting that epigenetic factors may play a central role in obesity. To investigate these relationships, we focus our attention on the most common epigenetic modifications that occur in obesity, including DNA methylation and post-translational modifications of histones. We also consider bariatric surgery as an epigenetic factor, evaluating how the anatomic and physiologic modifications induced by these surgical techniques can change gene expression. Here we discuss the importance of epigenetic mechanisms in chronic disease and cancer, and the role of epigenetic disturbances in obesity, with a focus on the role of bariatric surgery.", "DOI": "10.3390/ht9010006", "len_ids": "073-420-127-128-917", "time": [2020, 3, 23], "source": "question/lens", "label": "yes", "answer": "yes"}
{"title": "Transient confinement zones: a type of lipid raft?", "abstract": "Many important signaling events are initiated at the cell membrane. To facilitate efficient signal transduction upon stimulation, membrane microdomains, also known as lipid rafts, are postulated to serve as platforms to recruit components involved in the signaling complex, but few methods exist to study rafts in vivo. Single particle tracking provides an approach to study the plasma membrane of living cells on the nano-scale. The trajectories of single gold particles bound to membrane proteins and lipids are characterized in terms of both random and confined diffusion; the latter occurs in \"transient confinement zones\". Here we review transient confinement zones and some of their implications for membrane structure and function.", "DOI": "10.1007/s11745-004-1337-9", "len_ids": "006-306-738-325-590", "time": [2018, 5, 12], "source": "question/lens", "label": "Yes.", "answer": "yes"}
{"title": "Can the 33s pulsations observed from AE Aquarii be explained in terms of accretion onto the white dwarf surface?", "abstract": "The 33 s pulsing component observed from AE Aqr is frequently assumed to be the result of accretion onto the surface of a rotating white dwarf. The validity of this assumption is discussed in the present paper. I show that under the conditions of interest the white dwarf is in the state of supersonic propeller and the efficiency of plasma penetration into its magnetosphere is < 0.1%. This is too small to explain the observed luminosity of the pulsing component. Moreover, I find that for the currently established value of the angle between the magnetic and rotational axes of the white dwarf, the material entering the magnetosphere at the boundary can never reach its surface by flowing along the magnetic field lines. I conclude that the assumption about the direct accretion onto the surface of the white dwarf in AE Aqr contradicts the observational data obtained in the optical/UV and thus cannot be accepted.", "DOI": "10.1051/0004-6361:20010776", "source": "arxiv", "time": [2009, 11, 6], "label": "Yes.", "answer": "no"}
{"title": "Do spin state changes matter in organometallic chemistry? A computational study.", "abstract": "Spin changes occur often in organometallic chemistry, and their effect on kinetics is not well understood. We report computations on the singlet and triplet potential energy surfaces of several processes of this type and show that the topology of the individual surfaces, as well as of the crossing regions between them, can be used to rationalize the observed reactivity in all cases. In particular, the slow addition of dihydrogen to W[N(CH2CH2NSiMe3)3]H is shown to be a \u201cspin-blocked\u201d reaction with a high barrier due to the crossing between reactant triplet and product singlet surfaces. In contrast, addition of CO to TpCo(CO) is fast because the triplet and singlet surfaces cross at low energy. Particular care is taken to use DFT methods which are in adequate agreement with experimental and high-level computational...", "DOI": "10.1021/ja049346q", "len_ids": "044-418-550-863-017", "time": [2018, 5, 12], "source": "question/lens", "label": "Yes.", "answer": "yes"}

{"title": "Pulsatile Lavage During Cementation of Total Knee Arthroplasty - Is Fixation Impaired? A Cadaver Study.", "abstract": "Increasing economic pressure in modern healthcare necessitates an increase in efficiency in total knee arthroplasty (TKA) while maintaining high-quality outcomes. Removal of debris using pulsatile lavage (PL) during cement polymerization may considerably reduce the operative duration. However, water can penetrate the interface, resulting in impaired implant fixation. The aim of the present study was to investigate the impact of early-onset PL during bone cement polymerization on implant fixation and operative duration. Cemented implantation of tibial trays was performed in 20 fresh-frozen human tibiae from 10 donors in a matched-pair study design in two groups: 1) PL during cement polymerization; and 2) PL after completion of the polymerization process. The cement penetration depth was analysed by computed tomography (CT), and the pull-out force was measured to evaluate primary implant fixation. The duration of the procedure was recorded for both groups. Comparable pull-out forces were observed in the experimental (2,213 N) and control groups (2,350 N; p=0.68). The mean depth of cement penetration was similar in both groups. PL during cement polymerization could decrease the operative duration by 10 min. The application of PL during cement polymerization could significantly reduce operative duration and had no adverse effect on the mechanical fixation of the tibial component.

{"title": "Methylation and phosphorylation: a tangled relationship?", "abstract": "Many neurodegenerative diseases are associated with distinctive brain lesions. One particular group of heterogeneous dementias and movement disorders is characterized by intracellular accumulations of abnormal filaments called neurofibrillary tangles (NFT), formed by the microtubule-associated protein tau. These neurodegenerative tauopathies include Pick disease and Alzheimer disease (AD), but the term also encompasses a range of other clinical conditions that share a common end-point: neurodegeneration with pathological tau accumulation (1). Tau occurs predominantly in neuronal axons, where it binds to microtubules and regulates their length and \u201ctreadmilling\u201d dynamics. Tight regulation of microtubule activity is critical to cell viability, and fine regulation of tau is likely to be equally important (2). Tau activity is modulated by phosphorylation, and the ability of tau to bind to and stabilize microtubules correlates inversely with its degree of phosphorylation. This relationship has led to the suggestion of a role for tau in the adaptive response of neurons to stress (3). Tau phosphorylation may represent a physiological and reversible process integral to the stress response system. For example, in animal models, tau phosphorylation occurs in response to ether anesthesia, cold-water stress, and starvation (4). Tau is highly phosphorylated in several neurodegenerative diseases associated with NFT formation. Disordered phosphorylation disrupts the normal colocalization of tau with microtubules, leading to further phosphorylation at fibrillogenic sites and/or cleavage by caspases. This process increases the probability of tau-tau interactions leading to the formation of paired \u2026", "DOI": "10.1373/clinchem.2007.086579", "len_ids": "045-492-759-700-245", "subject": ["Biochemistry, medical", "Clinical Biochemistry", "Biochemistry (medical)"]}
{"title": "Can Weakly Coordinating Anions Stabilize Mercury in Its Oxidation State +IV?", "abstract": "While the thermochemical stability of gas-phase HgF4 against F2 elimination was predicted by accurate quantum chemical calculations more than a decade ago, experimental verification of \"truly transition-metal\" mercury(IV) chemistry is still lacking. This work uses detailed density functional calculations to explore alternative species that might provide access to condensed-phase Hg(IV) chemistry. The structures and thermochemical stabilities of complexes Hg(IV)X4 and Hg(IV)F2X2  have been assessed and are compared with each other, with smaller gas-phase HgX4 complexes, and with known related noble gas compounds. Most species eliminate F2 exothermically, with energies ranging from only about -60 kJ mol(-1) to appreciable -180 kJ mol(-1). The lower stability of these species compared to gas-phase HgF4 is due to relatively high coordination numbers of six in the resulting Hg(II) complexes that stabilize the elimination products. Complexes with AsF6 ligands appear more promising than their SbF6 analogues, due to differential aggregation effects in the Hg(II) and Hg(IV) states. HgF2X2 complexes with X- = OSeF5- or OTeF5- exhibit endothermic fluorine elimination and relatively weak interactions in the Hg(II) products. However, elimination of the peroxidic (OEF5)2 coupling products of these ligands provides an alternative exothermic elimination pathway with energies between -120 and -130 kJ mol(-1). While all of the complexes investigated here thus have one exothermic decomposition channel, there is indirect evidence that the reactions should exhibit nonnegligible activation barriers. A number of possible synthetic pathways towards the most interesting condensed-phase Hg(IV) target complexes are proposed.", "DOI": "10.1002/chem.200401130", "len_ids": "063-925-293-032-743", "subject": ["General Chemistry"]}

{"title": "105 LONG-TERM BISPHOSPHONATE THERAPY RESULTED IN SECONDARY HYPERPARATHYROIDISM?", "abstract": "Background Alendronate has been widely used in the treatment of patient with osteoporosis; several studies have demonstrated the long-term efficacy and safety of alendronate (Fosamax) in patient with osteoporosis. Secondary hyperparathyroidism has been described in patient with chronic renal failure due to stimulation of parathyroid cells by stimuli such as hyperphosphatemia, hypocalcemia and calcitriol deficiency, leading to parathyroid gland hyperplasia. Case Report We describe a patient who developed secondary hyperparathyroidism despite elevated levels of vitamin D, and normal renal function, while on alendronate, vitamin D and calcium for severe osteoporosis. In August 1998 a 43 year old female was referred to our endocrine clinic for severe osteoporosis. She was found to have normal PTH, serum calcium, phosphorus, urinary calcium excretion, and creatinine clearance. Her 25-hydroxyvitamin D [25-(OH)vitD] level was 16.4 ng/mL. She was started on alendronate 70 mg/w, vitamin D 50,000 IU/w, and calcium 2 g/d. She responded well to this treatment with improvement in her bone mineral density and vitamin D level. In June 2002 she developed secondary hyperparathyroidism, vitD = 45.1 ng/mL, 24 h urinary calcium = 240 mg/d). The patient eventually underwent neck exploration in 2004, during which 3 1/5 hyperplastic parathyroid glands were excised. Subsequently the PTH level returned to normal. Discussion Secondary hyperparathyroidism has classically been described in patients with renal failure or severe vitamin D deficiency due to constant stimulation of parathyroid cells by hyperphosphatemia, hypocalcemia and calcitriol deficiency, leading to parathyroid gland hyperplasia. Skeletal resistance to the calcemic action of PTH is another factor that appears to contribute to the genesis of secondary hyperparathyroidism in chronic renal failure. Recently several studies have demonstrated that alendronate impairs the ability of PTH to increase bone mineral density in osteoporotic patients, possibly by reducing the impact of PTH on bone formation. The present case demonstrates the occurrence of parathyroid hyperplasia and secondary hyperparathyroidism, despite absence of conventional etiologic factors. We propose the possibility of long-term alendronate therapy and skeletal resistance to the effect of PTH as a mechanism of hyperparathyroidism in this patient.", "DOI": "10.2310/6650.2005.00006.104", "len_ids": "144-809-517-192-69X", "subject": ["General Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology", "General Medicine"]}

The dispersion behavior is discussed with a view to its effect on the critical dynamics of the liquid near its consolute point. Attention is especially given to the relaxation rates of fluctuations of that system. The data as resulting from ultrasonic attenuation spectroscopy on the one hand and from quasi-elastic light scattering and viscosity measurements on the other hand differ near the critical temperature.

Functional inactivation of a single gene product, ATM, accounts for this compound phenotype.

In turn, ATM induces signalling through multiple pathways, thereby coordinating acute phase stress responses with cell cycle checkpoint control and repair of oxidative damage. Absence of ATM is proposed to limit the repair of insidious oxidative damage that can occur under normal physiological conditions, ultimately leading to apoptosis of particularly sensitive cells, such as neurons and thymocytes.", "DOI": "10.1002/bies.950191011", "len_ids": "028-422-814-720-776", "subject": ["General Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"]}

Eighteen participants with relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis (RRMS) and fifteen healthy controls participated in this study. Cognitive status, depression, and fatigue were assessed using the Multiple Sclerosis Inventory of Cognition (MUSIC), Beck's Depression Inventory (BDI-II), and the Fatigue Severity Scale (FSS). fMRI was recorded while a participant performed the modified attention network test (ANT). The effects of ANT executive attention network on hemodynamic activation of a priori defined regions of interest, including the hippocampus, anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), thalamus, caudate nucleus, pallidum, and putamen were studied. The individual lesion load was estimated. For fMRI data analysis a general linear model with randomization statistics including threshold-free cluster enhancement as implemented in the FSL software was used. Participants with RRMS showed reduced activation of the executive attention network in the hippocampus, pallidum, and ACC. The thalamus was involved in both group activations but did not differ between groups. In summary, functional changes in the brain can also be demonstrated in RRMS patients without cognitive deficits. The affected brain regions can best be assigned to the attention network for executive control.

Nitrous oxide is used in man to speed induction of anaesthesia with volatile anaesthetics, via a mechanism referred to as the \u201csecond gas\u201d effect. We therefore evaluated the addition of Nitrous Oxide (N2O) to a rising CO2 concentration could be used as a welfare refinement of the euthanasia process in mice, by shortening the duration of conscious exposure to CO2. Firstly, to assess the effect of N2O on the induction of anaesthesia in mice, 12 female C57Bl/6 mice were anaesthetized in a crossover protocol with the following combinations: Isoflurane (5%)+O2 (95%); Isoflurane (5%)+N2O (75%)+O2 (25%) and N2O (75%)+O2 (25%) with a total flow rate of 3l/min (into a 7l induction chamber). The addition of N2O to isoflurane reduced the time to loss of the righting reflex by 17.6%. Secondly, 18 C57Bl/6 and 18 CD1 mice were individually euthanized by gradually filling the induction chamber with either: CO2 (20% of the chamber volume.min\u22121); CO2+N2O ; or CO2+Nitrogen (N2) . Arterial partial pressure (Pa) of O2 and CO2 were measured as well as blood pH and lactate. When compared to the gradually rising CO2 euthanasia, addition of a high concentration of N2O to CO2 lowered the time to loss of righting reflex by 10.3% (P<0.001), lead to a lower PaO2 (12.55\u00b13.67 mmHg, P<0.001), a higher lactataemia (4.64\u00b11.04 mmol.l\u22121, P = 0.026), without any behaviour indicative of distress.

Problematically, this type of scales is plagued by response distortions-both deliberate and unintentional, particularly in occupational populations. The aim of the current study was to develop an objective index of resilience. The study was conducted in 30 young healthy adults. Following completion of the Connor-Davidson Resilience Scale (CD-RISC) and Depression/Anxiety/Stress Scale (DASS), they were subjected to a series of 15 acoustic startle stimuli (95 dB, 50 ms) presented at random intervals, with respiration, skin conductance and ECG recorded. As expected, resilience (CD-RISC) significantly and negatively correlated with all three DASS subscales-Depression (r = -0.66, p<0.0001), Anxiety (r = -0.50, p<0.005) and Stress (r = -0.48, p<0.005). Acoustic stimuli consistently provoked transient skin conductance (SC) responses, with SC slopes indexing response habituation. This slope significantly and positively correlated with DASS-Depression (r = 0.59, p<0.005), DASS-Anxiety (r = 0.35, p<0.05) and DASS-Total (r = 0.50, p<0.005) scores, and negatively with resilience score , indicating that high-resilience individuals are characterized by steeper habituation slopes compared to low-resilience individuals. Our key finding of the connection between habituation of the skin conductance responses to repeated acoustic startle stimulus and resilience-related psychometric constructs suggests that response habituation paradigm has the potential to characterize important attributes of cognitive fitness and well-being-such as depression, anxiety and resilience.

Recently, a role for autophagy in innate and adaptive immunity has also been established including the elimination of invading bacteria. Although some intracellular pathogens are killed by autophagy, several others subvert autophagy to the pathogen's benefit for survival and replication. Porphyromonas gingivalis, an important periodontal pathogen, has been shown to stimulate autophagy in endothelial cells and to use the autophagic pathway to its advantage. In human coronary artery endothelial cells (HCAEC), P. gingivalis localizes within autophagosomes. After intracellular uptake, P. gingivalis transits from early autophagosomes to late autophagosomes and prevents the formation of autolysosomes, either by delaying the autophagosome-lysosome fusion or by redirecting the normal autophagic trafficking. In addition, P. gingivalis was also found to stimulate autophagy in human aortic endothelial cells (HAEC) since co-localization of LC3-II, an autophagosome marker, with P. gingivalis was observed.

Large efforts have been made to control phosphorus, but the measures to reduce nitrogen emissions failed at least partly. While it was possible to reduce nitrogen emissions from industry and municipal wastewater treatment plants, diffuse sources are showing only very minor decline. Examples of limnetic, marine and coastal systems are given to review the current knowledge about nitrogen transformation and the effects of nitrate in the environment. When N is the limiting nutrient in a particular water body, this does not necessarily mean that phytoplankton is controllable by NO3 \u2010 removal. In systems with problems due to a high redox-sensitive internal phosphorus load and under certain constraints, nitrate may be used as an ecotechnological measure to prevent anaerobic phosphorus release from sediments. Model simulations are used to demonstrate this. A schematic model of redox-mediated temporal phosphorus storage in riverine lake sediments with short retention time is proposed. We conclude that while anthropogenic nitrogen emissions are a global problem, no fast and simple single solution exists. Additional nitrogen removal in wastewater treatment will have no effect, as long as diffuse sources and nitrate concentrations in groundwater remain at a high level.

Research on internet use by people with chronic conditions suggests that that 72% of these populations use the internet compared to 89% of those without these conditions (1). However, this research did not examine internet use by those with arthritis. Objectives This study examines the prevalence of general internet use, and two online health behaviors  in the US population of adults with arthritis compared with those without arthritis. Methods We analyzed data for respondents from the sample adult core (n=34,558) of the 2013 National Health Interview Survey which represents the US civilian, noninstitutionalized population.

{"title": "Two steps in the transition between the native and acid states of bovine \u03b1\u2010lactalbumin detected by circular polarization of luminescence: Evidence for a premolten globule state?", "abstract": "A few studies indirectly support the existence of an intermediate in the transition of Ca(2+)-saturated bovine alpha-lactalbumin (alpha-LA) from the native (N) to the acidic (A) state, known as the molten globule state. However, direct experimental evidence for the appearance of this intermediate has not been obtained. The signal of circular polarization of luminescence (CPL) is sensitive to fine conformational transitions because of its susceptibility to changes in the environmental asymmetry of fluorescent chromophores in their excited electronic states. In the present study, CPL measurements were applied using the intrinsic tryptophan fluorescence of alpha-LA as well as the fluorescence of 8-anilino-1-naphthalenesulfonic acid (ANS) bound to alpha-LA. CPL of tryptophan and ANS was measured in the pH range of 2.5-6 in order to find direct experimental evidence for the proposed intermediate. CPL ) depends on the asymmetry of the protein molecular structure in the environment of the tryptophan and the ANS chromophores in the excited electronic state. The pH dependence of both the gab, absorption anisotropy factor determined by CD, and the ANS steady state fluorescence, showed a single transition at pH 3-3.7 as already reported elsewhere. This transition was interpreted as being a result of a change of the alpha-LA tertiary structure, which resulted in a loss of asymmetry of the environment of both the tryptophan residues and the ANS hydrophobic binding sites. The pH dependence of the tryptophan and ANS g(em) showed an additional conformational transition at pH 4-5, which coincided with the pKa of Ca2+ dissociation (pKa 5), as predicted by Permyakov et al. . The titration curve showed that there is a pH range between 3.7 and 4.1 in which alpha-LA exists in an intermediate state between the N- and A-state. We suggest that the intermediate is the premolten globule state characterized by a reduced Ca2+ binding to the alpha-LA, native-like tertiary structure, and reduced asymmetric fluctuation of the tertiary structure on the nanosecond time scale. This intermediate resembles the \"critical activated state\" theoretically deduced by Kuwajima et al. (1989, J Mol Biol 206:547-561).

A Study with Hake and Blue Shark Skin Collagens", "abstract": "Acid-soluble collagens from European hake and Blue shark skin were isolated, characterized, and compared. As the structure of collagen determines its function, the final objective of this study was to investigate biochemical differences between both collagens to identify future potential applications. Chromatographic behavior revealed differences in collagen from both species. Increases of temperature and stirring time produced no effect on European hake collagen solubility in the mobile phase, resulting in the same chromatographic profiles. Conversely, the application of temperature and stirring-time increments showed a positive effect on Blue shark collagen solubility, resulting in different chromatographic profiles and observing higher molecular weight components when sample is incubated at 50 \u00b0C (15 min) after 48 h stirring. To test if the different chromatographic behavior exhibited by both collagens could be influenced by differences in subunit composition (alpha-chains), cation exchange chromatography was employed to separate collagen subunits. The electrophoretic patterns and gel permeation chromatography with light-scattering detection (GPC-LS) results of the obtained cation exchange peak fractions revealed differences regarding subunit composition between both species, influencing the crosslinking pattern.

However, the apparent modes of inheritance of predisposition or resistance differ considerably among diseases and among studies. A coherent genetic architecture of infectious diseases is lacking. We suggest here that life-threatening infectious diseases in childhood, occurring in the course of primary infection, result mostly from individually rare but collectively diverse single-gene variations of variable clinical penetrance, whereas the genetic component of predisposition to secondary or reactivation infections in adults is more complex. This model is consistent with (i) the high incidence of most infectious diseases in early childhood, followed by a steady decline; (ii) theoretical modeling of the impact of monogenic or polygenic predisposition on the incidence distribution of infectious diseases before reproductive age; (iii) available molecular evidence from both monogenic and complex genetics of infectious diseases in children and adults; (iv) current knowledge of immunity to primary and secondary or latent infections; (v) the state of the art in the clinical genetics of noninfectious pediatric and adult diseases; and (vi) evolutionary data for the genes underlying single-gene and complex disease risk.

{"title": "Antimicrobial Peptides (AMPs): Potential Therapeutic Strategy against Trypanosomiases?", "abstract": "Trypanosomiases are a group of tropical diseases that have devastating health and socio-economic effects worldwide. In humans, these diseases are caused by the pathogenic kinetoplastids Trypanosoma brucei, causing African trypanosomiasis or sleeping sickness, and Trypanosoma cruzi, causing American trypanosomiasis or Chagas disease. Currently, these diseases lack effective treatment. This is attributed to the high toxicity and limited trypanocidal activity of registered drugs, as well as resistance development and difficulties in their administration. All this has prompted the search for new compounds that can serve as the basis for the development of treatment of these diseases. Antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) are small peptides synthesized by both prokaryotes and (unicellular and multicellular) eukaryotes, where they fulfill functions related to competition strategy with other organisms and immune defense. These AMPs can bind and induce perturbation in cell membranes, leading to permeation of molecules, alteration of morphology, disruption of cellular homeostasis, and activation of cell death. These peptides have activity against various pathogenic microorganisms, including parasitic protists. Therefore, they are being considered for new therapeutic strategies to treat some parasitic diseases. In this review, we analyze AMPs as therapeutic alternatives for the treatment of trypanosomiases, emphasizing their possible application as possible candidates for the development of future natural anti-trypanosome drugs.", "DOI": "10.3390/biom13040599", "len_ids": "139-187-837-597-835", "subject": ["Molecular Biology", "Biochemistry"]}

{"title": "Conformational transitions provoked by organic solvents in \u03b2-lactoglobulin: can a molten globule like intermediate be induced by the decrease in dielectric constant?", "abstract": "Background: It is known that nonnative states of protein molecules can exist in living cells and can be involved in a number of physiological processes. It has also been established that the membrane surface can be responsible for the partial denaturation of proteins due to negative charges on it. The local decrease in the effective dielectric constant of water near the organic surface has been suggested to be an additional driving force for protein denaturation in the membrane field, but data to confirm this suggestion were lacking. Results: Conformational transitions induced in \u03b2 -lactoglobulin by methanol, ethanol, isopropanol, dimethylformamide and dioxane were studied by near and far UV circular dichroism, steady-state tryptophan fluorescence and fluorescence decay of 8-anilinonaphthalene-1-sulfonate (8-ANS). The existence of at least two noncoinciding cooperative transitions has been established in all solvent systems studied. The first of these transitions describes the disruption of rigid tertiary structure in protein molecules, while the second reflects the formation of an expanded helical conformation typical of proteins in concentrated organic solvents. This means that the organic solvents provoke the formation of a denatured intermediate state with pronounced secondary structure and native-like compactness. We show that the positions of maxima in f I versus dielectric constant dependence virtually coincide for all five solvent systems studied.

Primary HLH is genetic and presents in infancy. Secondary HLH (sHLH) presents in children or adults, and macrophage activation syndrome (MAS)1 is sHLH in the context of rheumatological disease. Risk factors include immunosuppression, infection, malignancy and autoimmunity. The HScore can be used to calculate probability of HLH2. Gold standard diagnosis is bone marrow aspirate (BMA)1. In paediatrics, ferritin >10,000\u03bcg/L is highly specific for HLH3, but less so in adults4. There is no validated treatment pathway for sHLH. Current recommendations are methylprednisolone and IVIG first line, and anakinra or etoposide if these are ineffective1. Objectives: This service evaluation assessed patients with a ferritin >10,000\u03bcg/L in Portsmouth Hospitals NHS Trust (PHT) against diagnostic criteria and recommended treatment for sHLH, with the aim of sharing results to improve recognition and management. Methods: Serum ferritin results >10,000\u03bcg/L from 1st March 2014 to 31st March 2019 were requested from PHT central laboratories. Paediatric and duplicate results were excluded. Electronic patient records were used to collect the parameters of the HScore2. HScore and probability of sHLH was calculated using a validated calculator2,5. Patient notes were requested for patients with missing data or probability of HLH >1%. Results: Fifty four results were obtained from central laboratories, of which thirty eight were eligible for analysis. Mean age was 63.6 (range 19 to 96), 34.2% male. 47.4% died within one year of ferritin >10,000\u03bcg/L. One patient was diagnosed with Adult Onset Still\u2019s Disease. Of the remainder, 73% had risk factors for sHLH. Accurate assessment of sHLH incidence was not possible due to incomplete data, particularly triglycerides, fibrinogen, and BMA. AST is not routinely collected in PHT, therefore ALT was used for audit. Within these limits, fifteen patients had a probability >1% of sHLH, and five had a probability >50%.

{"title": "Can dynamic occupancy models improve predictions of species\u2019 range dynamics? A test using Swiss birds", "abstract": "Predictions of species' current and future ranges are needed to effectively manage species under environmental change. Species ranges are typically estimated using correlative species distribution models (SDMs), which have been criticized for their static nature. In contrast, dynamic occupancy models explicitily describe temporal changes in species' occupancy via colonisation and local extinction probabilities, estimated from time series of occurrence data. Yet, tests of whether these models improve predictive accuracy under current or future conditions are rare. Using a long-term dataset on 69 Swiss birds, we tested whether dynamic occupancy models improve predictions of distribution changes over time compared to SDMs. We evaluated the accuracy of spatial predictions and their ability to detect population trends. We also explored how predictions differed when we accounted for imperfect detection and parameterised models using calibration datasets of different time series lengths. All model types had high spatial predictive performance when assessed across all sites (mean AUC > 0.8), with flexible machine-learning SDM algorithms outperforming parametric static and dynamic occupancy models. However, none of the models performed well at identifying sites where range changes are likely to occur. In terms of estimating population trends, dynamic occupancy models performed best, particularly for species with strong population changes and when fit with sufficient data, while static SDMs performed very poorly. Overall, our study highlights the importance of considering what aspects of performance matter most when selecting a modelling method for a particular application and the need for further research to improve model utility. While dynamic occupancy models show promise for capturing range dynamics and inferring population trends when fitted with sufficient data, computational constraints on variable selection and model fitting can lead to reduced spatial accuracy of predictions, an area warranting more attention.", "DOI": "10.1111/gcb.15723", "len_ids": "068-294-232-779-492", "subject": ["Ecology", "General Environmental Science", "Global and Planetary Change", "Environmental Chemistry"]}
{"title": "Can Octahedral t2g6 Complexes Substitute Associatively? The Case of the Isoelectronic Ruthenium(II) and Rhodium(III) Hexaaquaions", "abstract": "For the low-spin t2g6 Ru(OH2)6(2+)  and Rh(OH2)6(3+)  hexaaquaions, the respective Id and Ia water exchange mechanisms had been assigned, mainly on the basis of activation volumes delta V++ and entering ligands effects for water substitution. For Ru(II) the near-zero delta V++ was supposed to be due to the compensation between a positive contribution  and a negative one . Recently, it has been suggested that Rh(III), because of its higher positive charge, could promote further spectator ligands bond contraction sufficient to change the sign of delta V++ to a negative value. If true, this would be an example of limitation in the use of delta V++ for a direct diagnosis of the mechanism. Quantum chemical calculations including hydration effects show that the activation energies for the water exchange on Rh(OH2)6(3+) via the Ia (114.8 kJ mol-1) and the D pathways is 21.8 kJ mol-1 in favor of the former. In the case of Ru(OH2)6(2+) all attemps to compute a transition state for an interchange mechanism failed, but the calculated delta E++ for the D mechanism (71.9 kJ mol-1) is close to both experimental delta G298++ and delta H298++ values. The calculated delta sigma d(M-O) values of -0.53 A for rhodium(III) and +1.25 A for ruthenium(II) agree with the experimented delta V++ values and suggest Ia and D (or Id) mechanisms, respectively. In the case of Ru(OH2)6(2+) the shortening of the bonds of the five spectator ligands to reach the transition states corresponds to a volume change of -1.7 cm3 mol-1. For Rh(OH2)6(3+) these spectator ligands' volume decrease is much smaller (maximum of -0.8 cm3 mol-1) and the bond lengths of the two exchanging ligands at the transition state are characteristic of an interchange pathway with a small \"a\" character. Because of the strong RhIII-O bonds, water exchange on Rh(OH2)6(3+) proceeds via the Ia pathway with retention of the configuration, whereas the same reaction of Ru(OH2)6(2+), which has considerably weaker RuII-O bonds, follows the Id or the D mechanism.", "DOI": "10.1021/ic0008262", "len_ids": "071-406-671-533-330", "subject": ["Inorganic Chemistry", "Physical and Theoretical Chemistry"]}

{"title": "Recycling of thermoset structural composites: would textile technology bring a high added-value solution ?", "abstract": "manufacturing waste are still being landfilled or incinerated. Most of them are made of long or endless glass or carbon fibres and cross-linked thermosetting resin matrices, which are not easily recycled and remoulded. Recent changes to waste management legislation are however powerful drivers to identify more environmental friendly and economically viable recycling routes for such thermoset composites. Many attempts have been made over the past twenty years to develop recycling processes  and seek ways of cost-effectively using recycled material  in various applications . In spite of the huge research efforts, the industrial achievements are globally disappointing up to now as far as closed-loop recycling of structural composites  is concerned. Indeed, one should keep in mind that the glass or carbon fiber reinforcement has potentially the most recoverable value in a structural composite, and that fiber length and fiber alignment are key features in composites design. That means that mechanical grinding, which dramatically reduces the fiber aspect ratio and cannot preserve continuous fibers, and further re-use as random compounds are obviously inappropriate in the case of structural composites. Textile technology may bring a solution to overcome this problem. Patented textile technologies already allow manufacturing from dry fibre waste (selvedges, offcuts ...) high added-value aligned fibre products such as veils, tapes or continuous yarns which could be re-used to form fabrics. However, glass or carbon fibres recovered by pyrolysis or solvolysis are more challenging to process that way because contrary to dry fibres (i) they do not retain the sizing applied to the virgin fibres at manufacture and would require further surface treatment; (ii) they are not fully \u2018clean\u2019, polluting residues or small resin pieces being possibly still attached to their surface; (iii) their mechanical properties (strength, modulus) may be significantly reduced in some cases (e.g. if recovered by pyrolysis).

{"title": "Do \u201chot moments\u201d become hotter under climate change? Soil nitrogen dynamics from a climate manipulation experiment in a post-harvest forest", "abstract": "Whole-tree forest harvest can increase soil nitrous oxide (N2O) effluxes and leaching of nitrogen (N) from soils. These altered N dynamics are often linked to harvesting effects on microclimate, suggesting that this \u201chot moment\u201d for N cycling may become hotter with climate change. We hypothesized that increases in temperature and precipitation during this post-harvest period would increase availability of soil mineral N and soil-atmosphere N2O efflux. To test this hypothesis we implemented a climate manipulation experiment after a forest harvest, and measured soil N2O fluxes and inorganic N accumulating on ion exchange resins. Climate treatments were: control (A, ambient), heated (H, +2.5 \u00b0C), wetted (W, +23 % precipitation), and a two-factor treatment (H+W). For all treatments, the first year after harvest had highest N2O efflux and resin N. Wetting significantly increased cumulative soil N2O fluxes, but only when soils were not heated too. The cumulative soil-to-atmosphere N2O efflux from W (5.8 mg N2O\u2013N m\u22122) was significantly higher than A (\u22121.9 mg N2O\u2013N m\u22122), but H+W (~0 mg N2O\u2013N m\u22122) was similar to A. Regardless of wetting, heating increased resin N, but only on certain dates. Cumulative resin N was on average 125 % greater in the H plots than non-heated plots. Thus, changes in temperature and precipitation each impart distinct changes to the soil N cycle.

{"title": "Hematopoietic Dysfunction during Graft-Versus-Host Disease: A Self-Destructive Process?", "abstract": "Graft-versus-host disease (GvHD) is a major complication of allogeneic hematopoietic (stem) cell transplantation (HCT). Clinically, GvHD is associated with severe and long-lasting hematopoietic dysfunction, which may contribute to the high mortality of GvHD after HCT. During GvHD, excessive immune activation damages both hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells and their surrounding bone marrow niche, leading to a reduction in cell number and functionality of both compartments. Hematopoietic dysfunction can be further aggravated by the occurrence-and treatment-of HCT-associated complications. These include immune suppressive therapy, coinciding infections and their treatment, and changes in the microbiome. In this review, we provide a structured overview of GvHD-mediated hematopoietic dysfunction, including the targets in the bone marrow, the mechanisms of action and the effect of GvHD-related complications and their treatment. This information may aid in the identification of treatment options to improve hematopoietic function in patients, during and after GvHD.", "DOI": "10.3390/cells10082051", "len_ids": "008-613-366-126-39X", "subject": ["General Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology", "General Medicine"]}

Fishmeal samples were placed under UVA or UVB light for 2, 5, and 10 days. Subsequently, analysis of amino acid content, lipid oxidation marker, ethoxyquin content, dioxin, and polychlorinated biphenyl (PCB) profiling was carried out. Exposure of fishmeal for 5 days to UVB light resulted in the degradation of approximately 70% of the dioxin content, while UVA had little effect, only resulting in the degradation of 10% of the dioxin content. UVB did not affect the protein and amino acid content of fishmeal; however, lipid oxidation was triggered. Addition of ethoxyquin prevented oxidation but simultaneously slowed dioxin breakdown. Increasing UVB intensity resulted in a more efficient dioxin degradation of 90%. Exposure of fishmeal to UVB also resulted in an increase in PCBs. UVB light is shown to photodegrade dioxin in fishmeal, indicating the needs to further investigation of methods for application at industrial scale.", "DOI": "10.1021/jf0509963", "len_ids": "035-252-700-225-253", "subject": ["General Agricultural and Biological Sciences", "General Chemistry"]}
{"title": "Is the Backbone Conformation of C\u03b1\u2010Methyl Proline Restricted to a Single Region?", "abstract": "C(alpha)-methyl-L-proline, or L-(alphaMe)Pro, is probably the most conformationally constrained alpha-amino acid. In particular, its omega and phi torsion angles are restricted to about 180 and -60 degrees, respectively, and only three ranges of values are theoretically available for psi in mono- or longer peptides, namely, about -30 degrees (cis', 3(10)/alpha-helical structure), 60 degrees (inverse gamma turn), or 140 degrees (trans', poly(L-Pro)(n) II structure). In this work, we examined the tendency of a number of N(alpha)-acyl dipeptide N'-alkylamides of the type RCO-(alphaMe)Pro-Xxx-NHR' or RCO-Xxx-(alphaMe)Pro-NHR', in which Xxx is L (or D)-Ala, Aib (alpha-aminoisoburyric acid), or L (or D)-(alphaMe)Pro, long enough to fold into intramolecularly hydrogen-bonded gamma or beta turns. The results are compared with those obtained for the corresponding dipeptides based on Pro, a well-known turn-forming residue. For the crystal-state 3D-structural analysis we used X-ray diffraction, whereas our solution conformational analysis was heavily based on the FTIR absorption and (1)H and (13)C NMR spectroscopy techniques. We conclude that (alphaMe)Pro is able to explore both trans' and cis' psi areas of the conformational space, but in (alphaMe)Pro the latter is overwhelmingly more populated, in marked contrast to the Pro preference. This finding is a clear indication that in (alphaMe)Pro the major 3D-structural determinant is the C(alpha)-methyl group. The circular dichroism (CD) signature of a peptide type III' beta-turn conformation is also proposed.", "DOI": "10.1002/chem.200900688", "len_ids": "068-403-372-518-85X", "subject": ["General Chemistry"]}

Insights from Germany.", "abstract": "Background Large proportions of the populations in many European countries, including Germany, are migrants. Migrant children and adolescents tend to be less physically active than their non-migrant peers. However, current research is limited as it does not sufficiently consider different domains of physical activity. Using a representative dataset, the present study examines the patterns of sports participation and other domains of physical activity among migrant and non-migrant children and adolescents residing in Germany. Methods Nationwide data from the Motorik-Modul (MoMo) Study is used. Five different domains of physical activity participation  were compared between children and adolescents with no, one-sided and two-sided migration background using logistic regression adjusted for demographic factors. Interaction terms were included in order to examine whether difference between the three groups differ by age and gender. Results Information on n = 3,323 children and adolescents was available. As compared to non-migrants, children and adolescents with a two-sided migration background had a 40% , those with a one-sided migration background a 26% (aOR = 0.74, 95%-CI: 0.55-<1.00) lower chance of participating in sport club activities.

{"title": "Does air pollution increase child mortality? Evidence from 58 developing countries.", "abstract": "This study aims to investigate the effects of air quality on child mortality in developing countries. We consider annual data covering the period from 2010 to 2016 of 58 countries and estimate the empirical models using recently developed panel quantile regression with the method of moments (MM-QR). It is found that outdoor air quality  has a positive and significant effect on total child mortality, post-neonatal mortality, and under-five child mortality. However, its effect on neonatal mortality is not statistically significant at lower quantiles. Furthermore, Household air pollution (HAP) also has a positive and significant effect on total child mortality, neonatal mortality, and under-five child mortality. The effect of HAP on post-neonatal mortality is not significant in most cases. Overall, the adverse effect of HAP is larger than the PM2.5. For instance, a 1% increase of PM2.5 concentration in the outdoor causes 0.231% total child mortality due to respiratory diseases at [Formula: see text], while a 1% increase of HAP causes 0.532% total child mortality at the same quantile. In many cases, the coefficients of PM2.5 and HAP increase at the higher quantiles, supporting asymmetric effects of pollutants on child mortality. However, per capita income, access to basic drinking water and sanitation facilities, and domestic and external health expenditures significantly reduce child mortality. On the contrary, open defecation increases mortality. Consequently, policymakers should take adequate measures to improve indoor and outdoor air quality to combat child mortality due to respiratory diseases in developing countries. They should also take initiatives to enhance per capita income, basic drinking water, and sanitation facilities, domestic and external health expenditures, and public awareness against open defecation.", "DOI": "10.1007/s11356-021-18319-z", "len_ids": "123-906-682-423-626", "subject": ["Health, Toxicology and Mutagenesis", "Environmental Chemistry", "General Medicine", "Pollution"]}

This study examines land-use changes, soil and water conservation, soil erosion and soil productivity in the Highlands of Kenya. In addition, it examines farmers' perception of livelihood changes. Land-use changes were determined from interpretations of aerial photographs taken in 1960 and 1996. Additional information on land use, soil and water conservation and livelihood changes were obtained from discussions and interviews with farmers, as well as from field verifications of the most recent aerial photographs. Soil samples were analysed and soil erosion assessed according to the PLUS classification scheme. The results indicate that substantial changes in land use, such as introduction of coffee and high-yielding maize, and fragmentation of land holdings have taken place. Less land was conserved in 1996 as compared to 1960. Moreover, SWC practices have changed from fanya chini terraces and shifting cultivation to bench terraces and permanent cultivation. Rates of soil nutrients (organic C, N and K) and maize-yield levels decreased significantly with increasing erosion. Farmers' perception of livelihood changes was differentiated according to farmers' off-farm resource 60 per cent of the farmers depended on income from the land and thought livelihoods were better in the 1960s. It is concluded that more efforts to decrease soil erosion and investments in land and labour are necessary to sustain soil productivity and hence secure rural livelihoods.

Although anatase TiO2 exhibits high electron mobility in the bulk, a commonly held belief is that strong coupling between electrons and phonons can lead to electron trapping at anatase surfaces. However, direct evidence is scarce, and the nature of the trapping sites and electronic properties remains unclear. To address this question, we investigate the trapping of electrons and holes at low and high index surfaces of anatase TiO2 using an accurate hybrid density functional theory approach.

Few empirical studies have investigated the role of social conformity in the maintenance of traditions despite an increasing body of literature on the formation of behavioural patterns in non-human animals. The current report presents a field experiment with free-ranging marmosets (Callithrix jacchus) which investigated whether social conformity is necessary for the maintenance of behavioural patterns within groups or whether individual effects such as habit formation would suffice. Methods Using a two-action apparatus, we established alternative behavioural patterns in six family groups composed of 36 individuals. These groups experienced only one technique during a training phase and were thereafter tested with two techniques available. The monkeys reliably maintained the trained method over a period of three weeks, despite discovering the alternative technique. Three additional groups were given the same number of sessions, but those 21 individuals could freely choose the method to obtain a reward. In these control groups, an overall bias towards one of the two methods was observed, but animals with a different preference did not adjust towards the group norm.

The participation of PrPc in tumor growth and metastasis was pointed out, but the underlying mechanisms were not deciphered completely. In the constantly renewing intestinal epithelium, our group demonstrated a dual localization of PrPc, which is targeted to cell-cell junctions in interaction with Src kinase and desmosomal proteins in differentiated enterocytes, but is predominantly nuclear in dividing cells. While the role of PrPc in the dynamics of intercellular junctions was confirmed in other biological systems, we unraveled its function in the nucleus only recently. We identified several nuclear PrPc partners, which comprise \u03b3-catenin, one of its desmosomal partners, \u03b2-catenin and TCF7L2, the main effectors of the canonical Wnt pathway, and YAP, one effector of the Hippo pathway. PrPc up-regulates the activity of the \u03b2-catenin/TCF7L2 complex and its invalidation impairs the proliferation of intestinal progenitors. We discuss how PrPc could participate to oncogenic processes through its interaction with Wnt and Hippo pathway effectors, which are controlled by cell-cell junctions and Src family kinases and dysregulated during tumorigenesis.

{"title": "Is the Air Too Polluted for Outdoor Activities? Check by Using Your Photovoltaic System as an Air-Quality Monitoring Device", "abstract": "Over the past few decades, the concentrating photovoltaic systems, a source of clean and renewable energy, often fully integrated into the roof structure, have been commonly installed on private houses and public buildings. The purpose of those panels is to transform the incoming solar radiation into electricity thanks to the photovoltaic effect. The produced electric power is affected, in the first instance, by the solar panel efficiency and its technical characteristics, but it is also strictly dependent on site elevation, the meteorological conditions and on the presence of the atmospheric constituents, i.e., clouds, hydrometeors, gas molecules and sub-micron-sized particles suspended in the atmosphere that can scatter and absorb the incoming shortwave solar radiation. The Aerosol Optical Depth (AOD) is an adimensional wavelength-dependent atmospheric column variable that accounts for aerosol concentration. AOD can be used as a proxy to evaluate the concentration of surface particulate matter and atmospheric column turbidity, which in turn affects the solar panel energy production. In this manuscript, a new technique is developed to retrieve the AOD at 550 nm through an iterative process: the atmospheric optical depth, incremented in steps of 0.01, is used as input together with the direct and diffuse radiation fluxes computed by Fu\u2013Liou\u2013Gu Radiative Transfer Model, to forecast the produced electric energy by a photovoltaic panel through a simple model. The process will stop at that AOD value (at 550 nm), for which the forecast electric power will match the real produced electric power by the photovoltaic panel within a previously defined threshold. This proof of concept is the first step of a wider project that aims to develop a user-friendly smartphone application where photovoltaic panel owners, once downloaded it on a voluntary basis, can turn their photovoltaic system into a sunphotometer to continuously retrieve the AOD, and more importantly, to monitor the air quality and detect strong air pollution episodes that pose a threat for population health.", "DOI": "10.3390/s21196342", "len_ids": "013-052-729-452-252", "subject": ["Analytical Chemistry", "Biochemistry", "Electrical and Electronic Engineering", "Atomic and Molecular Physics, and Optics"]}
{"title": "Multilayered membrane spacer: does it enhance solution mixing?", "abstract": "The present review systematically investigates and illustrates the effect of multilayered membrane spacers on the features of fluid dynamics that influence all performance metrics. Multilayer spacers are frequently composed of three sets of filaments , which has the benefit of increasing mass transfer and decreasing membrane surface fouling when compared to ordinary monolayer (e.g., extruded spacer) and two-layer spacers. The review found that the multilayer spacer's middle layer disperses primary flow to the thin side spacers placed near the membrane's surfaces. The thin side spacers will then form narrow passageways to keep the solution in situ for as long as mass transfer is achievable. The employment of thin spacers close to the membranes at satisfactory operational conditions (e.g., adequate flow velocity) results in swirling flows and incorporation of transverse and longitudinal eddies near to the membranes, reducing the boundary layer's width and making the associated ion concentration domain at the membranes much more consistent. The concept and implementation of multilayer geometry in feed channels appears to be promising, since a multilayered spacer can function at a lower maximum flow velocity than normal two-layer spacers, saving operational energy while minimizing concentration gradients at the membrane surfaces. Furthermore, the multilayer structure's durability and mechanical strength may help to reduce membrane deformation and maintain long processes. Future studies might look at significantly reducing spacer thickness for industrial uses.

Results for temporal change in seasonality showed mixed pattern/trend across the stations.

{"title": "Neutrophils in Tumorigenesis: Missing Targets for Successful Next Generation Cancer Therapies?", "abstract": "Neutrophils-once considered as simple killers of pathogens and unexciting for cancer research-are now acknowledged for their role in the process of tumorigenesis. Neutrophils are recruited to the tumor microenvironment where they turn into tumor-associated neutrophils (TANs), and are able to initiate and promote tumor progression and metastasis. Conversely, anti-tumorigenic properties of neutrophils have been documented, highlighting the versatile nature and high pleiotropic plasticity of these polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMN-L). Here, we dissect the ambivalent roles of TANs in cancer and focus on selected functional aspects that could be therapeutic targets. Indeed, the critical point of targeting TAN functions lies in the fact that an immunosuppressive state could be induced, resulting in unwanted side effects. A deeper knowledge of the mechanisms linked to diverse TAN functions in different cancer types is necessary to define appropriate therapeutic strategies that are able to induce and maintain an anti-tumor microenvironment.", "DOI": "10.3390/ijms22136744", "len_ids": "064-877-415-750-552", "subject": ["Inorganic Chemistry", "Spectroscopy", "General Medicine", "Physical and Theoretical Chemistry", "Catalysis", "Molecular Biology", "Computer Science Applications", "Organic Chemistry"]}

{"title": "Evolution of Asthma Severity in a Cohort of Young Adults: Is There Any Gender Difference?", "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Little is known about the distribution of asthma severity in men and women in the general population. The objective of our study was to describe asthma severity and change in severity according to gender in a cohort of adult asthmatics METHODS: Subjects with asthma were identified from random samples of the 22 to 44 year-olds from the general population, screened for asthma from 1991 to 1993 in 48 centers from 22 countries and followed-up during 1998-2002, as part of the European Community Respiratory Health Survey (ECRHS). All participants to follow-up with current asthma at baseline were eligible for the analysis. To assess change over the follow-up, asthma severity at the two surveys was defined using standardized data on respiratory symptoms, lung function and medication according to the Global Initiative for Asthma (GINA) Guidelines. Another quantitative score (Ronchetti) further considering hospitalizations was also analysed. RESULTS: The study included 685 subjects with asthma followed-up over a mean period of 8.65 yr (min 4.3-max 11.7). At baseline, asthma severity according to GINA was distributed as intermittent: 40.7%, 31.7% as mild persistent, 14% as moderate persistent, and 13.5% as severe persistent. Using the Ronchetti score derived classification, the distribution of asthma severity was 58% mild, (intermittent and mild persistent), 25.8% moderate, and 15.4% severe. Whatever the classification, there was no significant difference in the severity distribution between men and women. There was also no gender difference in the severity distribution among incident cases which developed asthma between the two surveys. Men with moderate-to-severe asthma at baseline were more likely than women to have moderate-to-severe asthma at follow-up. Using GINA, 69.2% of men vs. 53.1% of women (p = 0.09) with moderate-to-severe asthma at baseline were still moderate-to-severe at follow-up. Using Ronchetti score, 53.3% of men vs. 36.2% of women (p = 0.03) with moderate-to-severe asthma at baseline were still moderate-to-severe at follow-up.

{"title": "Can grammatical morphemes be taught? Evidence of gestures influencing second language procedural learning in middle childhood.", "abstract": "What kind of practice makes perfect when children learn to use grammatical morphemes in a second language? Gestures are communicative hand and arm movements which teachers naturally employ as a teaching tool in the classroom. Gesture theory has proposed that gestures package information and previous studies suggest their value for teaching specific items, such as words, as well as abstract systems, such as language. There is broad consensus that implicit learning mechanisms in children are more developed than explicit ones and that everyday use of grammar is implicit and entails developing implicit knowledge. However, while many learners have difficulties acquiring new morpho-syntactic structures, such as the plural{-s} and 3rd person possessive {-s} in English, research on gesture and syntax in middle childhood remains rare. The present study (N = 19) was conducted to better understand if gestures which embody grammatical morphemes during instruction can contribute to procedural learning. Using a novel task, the gesture speeded fragment completion task, our behavioral results show a decrease in mean response times after instruction in the test condition utilizing syntactically specific gestures. This increase in procedural learning suggests that learners in this age group can benefit from embodied instruction in the classroom which visually differentiates between grammatical morphemes which differ in meaning but sound the same.", "DOI": "10.1371/journal.pone.0280543", "len_ids": "160-679-233-183-166", "subject": ["General Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology", "General Medicine", "Multidisciplinary", "General Agricultural and Biological Sciences"]}

While expression variation may be a byproduct of, for example, dynamic or homeostatic processes, here we consider whether single-cell molecular variation per se might be crucial for population-level function. Under this hypothesis, molecular variation indicates a diversity of hidden functional capacities within an ensemble of identical cells, and this functional diversity facilitates collective behavior that would be inaccessible to a homogenous population. In reviewing this topic, we explore possible functions that might be carried by a heterogeneous ensemble of cells; however, this question has proven difficult to test, both because methods to manipulate molecular variation are limited and because it is complicated to define, and measure, population-level function. We consider several possible methods to further pursue the hypothesis that variation is function through the use of comparative analysis and novel experimental techniques.", "DOI": "10.1002/bies.201500124", "len_ids": "131-037-319-695-836", "subject": ["General Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"]}
{"title": "Thyroid hypofunction in Down's syndrome: is it related to oxidative stress?", "abstract": "Oxidative stress affecting the thyroxin biosynthesis might explain the proneness of patients with Down\u2019s syndrome (DS) (trisomia 21) to develop hypothyroidism. Thyroideal cells are exposed to endogenous H2O2 that acts as a cofactor for the iodination of thyroxin precursors. The gland has high levels of selenium-containing proteins, including peroxide-detoxicating enzyme proteins. The object of the present study was to explore the hypothesis of a role of an imbalance between toxic oxygen production and protective metalloenzymes during the development of thyroid hypofunction in DS patients. We analyzed serum levels of thyroid hormones and trace metals in 38 institutionalized adults with DS, using mentally retarded subjects matched for age, sex, and behavioral function as controls. The DS patients had significantly lower mean values of free thyroxin (fT4) and increased TSH (thyroid stimulating hormone), as compared to the controls. They had lower serum selenium than the controls. A positive correlation was observed between serum concentrations of fT4 and selenium in the DS patients (r=0.393, p<0.05). No significant differences were found between the fT4 or the TSH concentrations in the patients with and without circulating antithyroid autoantibodies. Our results support the suggestion that thyroid hypofunction in patients with Down\u2019s syndrome in some way is linked to the low serum levels of selenium found in these patients. It is suggested that selenium-containing proteins are involved in thyroid hormonal synthesis, by protecting biosynthetic processes against the toxicity of free oxygen radicals.", "DOI": "10.1385/bter:78:1-3:35", "len_ids": "017-638-280-917-42X", "subject": ["Biochemistry", "Inorganic Chemistry", "Biochemistry (medical)", "General Medicine", "Clinical Biochemistry", "Endocrinology, Diabetes and Metabolism", "Biochemistry, medical"]}

With both tissues, CT activity was present in cytosolic and microsomal fractions, but in brain, CT activity seemed to escape to an inhibiting feed back mechanism. In brain, CT activity was greater in the microsomal fraction, whilst in liver, a higher CT activity was seen in the cytosolic fraction. In liver fractions of aged animals, there was no significant change in CT activity or its sensitivity to negative feedback regulation, as compared to young animals. In contrast, a progressive age related decline in CT activity was observed in the brain microsomal fraction. Furthermore, the incorporation of newly formed CDPCho into PtdCho was also reduced in aged animals, and paralleled the decreased incorporation of choline in PtdCho. The age-related decrease in CT activity cannot be explained by product feed back inhibition or decreased diacylglycerol levels. Since PtdCho is a major membrane lipid, the reduction in CT activity may lead to a decreased membrane integrity and fluidity during the aging process, and these effects may be greater in neuronal cells.", "DOI": "10.1111/j.1749-6632.1993.tb23034.x", "len_ids": "046-812-782-218-736", "subject": ["General Neuroscience", "General Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology", "History and Philosophy of Science"]}

This study aimed to assess the relationship between maternal PFAS exposure and fetal reproductive hormones. A total of 752 mother-infant pairs who were recruited in the Shanghai Birth Cohort Study between 2013 and 2016 were selected. We quantified 10 PFAS, including two short-chain PFAS congeners , in maternal blood plasma in early pregnancy. Dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate (DHEA-S), sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG), luteinizing hormone (LH), follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) and total testosterone (TT) were measured in the umbilical cord blood using chemiluminescence kits. Free androgen index (FAI) was calculated by TT divided by SHBG. Multiple linear regression found that one ln-unit increase in maternal PFBS was associated with decreases in FSH (-0.159; 95% CI: -0.290, -0.029), LH (-0.113; 95% CI: -0.221, -0.004), and FAI (-0.009; 95% CI: -0.017, -0.001). In addition, PFHpA showed negative associations with LH (-0.154; 95% CI: -0.297, -0.011) and FAI (-0.008; 95% CI: -0.014, -0.002). When PFAS were analyzed in quartiles, significant negative associations were observed between PFBS and FSH, and between PFHpA and FAI. Overall, prenatal exposure to PFBS and PFHpA was associated with the disturbance of fetal gonadotropins as well as free androgen level in this prospective cohort, suggesting that the reproductive toxicity of short-chain PFAS may not be neglected.", "DOI": "10.1021/acs.est.0c02444", "len_ids": "006-297-592-398-540", "subject": ["Environmental Chemistry", "General Chemistry"]}

While both DMDPP and DPP contain two C=O groups, the latter also has two NH groups. As these groups are known to form hydrogen bonds with alcohol solvents, the present work is aimed at finding out whether or not such solute\u2013solvent hydrogen bonding is effecting the rotation of the probe molecules. The rotational dynamics of DMDPP is explained reasonably well by the Stokes\u2013Einstein\u2013Debye (SED) hydrodynamic theory with slip boundary condition. It is also found that the hydrogen bonding between the two C=O groups of the probe and the solvent molecules is not influencing the rotation of DMDPP. However, the reorientation times of DPP are found to be longer by a factor of 2.2 to 3.3 compared to that of DMDPP, and followed a super-stick behavior which has been observed for the first time for a nonpolar solute molecule. This is due to the strong hydrogen bonding between the two NH groups of the probe, and the alcoholic solvent molecules.", "DOI": "10.1063/1.478928", "len_ids": "032-040-475-049-64X", "subject": ["General Physics and Astronomy", "Physical and Theoretical Chemistry"]}

The F18choline PET/CT was negative for recurrent prostate cancer. However, intense choline uptake was seen in a small lesion adjacent to the right lower pole of the thyroid (Figure 1). As we found out, the patient was analyzed for a primary hyperparathyroidism at the same time. Laboratory values were: calcium, 2.84 mmol/L (normal 2.15\u2013 2.55); PTH, 91.8 pg/L (normal 80); and vitamin D, 31.4 ng/mL (normal 30\u201374). Thus, we evoked the hypothesis of a right-sided parathyroid adenoma (PTA). A few days later, parathyroid scintigraphy with Tc99m-sestamibi (MIBI) and ultrasonography were performed, and both were concordant with the PET/CT findings. The PTA was subsequently removed by minimally invasive surgery. Histology confirmed the diagnosis. After surgery, calcium levels normalized. To our knowledge, this is the first report of PTA localization with F18-choline PET/CT. We found one report of a C11-choline-positive PTA (1). The potential advantages of a PET tracer instead of MIBI for PTA localization are better spatial resolution allowing for smaller lesion detection and a shorter study protocol due to the rapid biokinetics of choline (2, 3). F18-choline is preferable over C11choline due to its much better availability worldwide and its favorable imaging characteristics. In conclusion, F18-choline PET/CT seems a promising new tool in PTA imaging. A prospective validation focusing on its usefulness as a second-line tracer in the one-third of MIBI negative patients (4) is required.", "DOI": "10.1210/jc.2013-2084", "len_ids": "116-306-596-572-833", "subject": ["Clinical Biochemistry", "Endocrinology, Diabetes and Metabolism", "Endocrinology", "Biochemistry, medical", "Biochemistry"]}
{"title": "May smart technologies reduce the environmental impact of nitrogen fertilization? A case study for paddy rice.", "abstract": "Precision agriculture is increasingly considered as a powerful solution to mitigate the environmental impact of farming systems. This is because of its ability to use multi-source information in decision support systems to increase the efficiency of farm management. Among the agronomic practices for which precision agriculture concepts were applied in research and operational contexts, variable rate (VR) nitrogen fertilization plays a key role. A promising approach to make quantitative, spatially distributed diagnoses to support VR N fertilization is based on the combined use of remote sensing information and few smart scouting-driven ground estimates to derive maps of nitrogen nutrition index (NNI). In this study, a new smart app for field NNI estimates (PocketNNI) was developed, which can be integrated with remote sensing data. The environmental impact of using PocketNNI and Sentinel 2 products to drive fertilization was evaluated using the Life Cycle Assessment approach and a case study on rice in northern Italy. In particular, the environmental performances of rice fertilized according to VR information derived from the integration of PocketNNI and satellite data was compared with a treatment based on uniform N application. Primary data regarding the cultivation practices and the achieved yields were collected during field tests. Results showed that VR fertilization allowed reducing the environmental impact by 11.0% to 13.6% as compared to uniform N application. For Climate Change, the impact is reduced from 937.3 to 832.7\u00a0kg CO2 eq/t of paddy rice. The highest environmental benefits \u2013 mainly due to an improved ratio between grain yield and N fertilizers \u2013 were achieved in terms of energy consumption for fertilizer production and of emission of N compounds. Although further validation is needed, these preliminary results are promising and provide a first quantitative indication of the environmental benefits that can be achieved when digital technologies are used to support N fertilization.", "DOI": "10.1016/j.scitotenv.2020.136956", "len_ids": "054-186-773-933-361", "subject": ["Environmental Engineering", "Environmental Chemistry", "Waste Management and Disposal", "Pollution"]}

There is equivocal evidence that children of older fathers are at increased risk of neurodevelopmental disorders and reduced IQ. We therefore report here on the relationship between paternal age and a composite indicator of scholastic achievement during adolescence, i.e. compulsory school leaving grades, among recent birth cohorts in Stockholm County where delayed paternity is notably common. We performed a record-linkage study comprising all individuals in Stockholm County who finished 9 years of compulsory school from 2000 through 2007 (n = 155,875). Data on school leaving grades and parental characteristics were retrieved from administrative and health service registers and analyzed using multiple linear regression. Advancing paternal age at birth was not associated with a decrease in school leaving grades in adolescent offspring. After adjustment for year of graduation, maternal age and parental education, country of birth and parental mental health service use, offspring of fathers aged 50 years or older had on average 0.3 (95% CI \u22123.8, 4.4) points higher grades than those of fathers aged 30\u201334 years.

Therefore, understanding the changes that occur as a result of aging is central to any possible prevention or cure for such conditions. Microglia, the resident brain glial population most associated with both protection of neurons in health and their destruction is disease, could be a significant player in age related changes. Microglia can adopt an aberrant phenotype sometimes referred to either as dystrophic or senescent. While aged microglia have been frequently identified in neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease, there is no conclusive evidence that proves a causal role. This has been hampered by a lack of models of aged microglia. We have recently generated a model of senescent microglia based on the observation that all dystrophic microglia show iron overload. Iron-overloading cultured microglia causes them to take on a senescent phenotype and can cause changes in models of neurodegeneration similar to those observed in patients. This review considers how this model could be used to determine the role of senescent microglia in neurodegenerative diseases.", "DOI": "10.1111/jnc.14860", "len_ids": "019-328-382-693-956", "subject": ["Cellular and Molecular Neuroscience", "Biochemistry"]}

Alterations in early and late visually evoked EEG potentials in Asperger observers.", "abstract": "Background Asperger Autism is a lifelong psychiatric condition with highly circumscribed interests and routines, problems in social cognition, verbal and nonverbal communication, and also perceptual abnormalities with sensory hypersensitivity. To objectify both lower-level visual and cognitive alterations we looked for differences in visual event-related potentials (EEG) between Asperger observers and matched controls while they observed simple checkerboard stimuli. Methods In a balanced oddball paradigm checkerboards of two checksizes (0.6\u00b0 and 1.2\u00b0) were presented with different frequencies. Participants counted the occurrence times of the rare fine or rare coarse checkerboards in different experimental conditions. We focused on early visual ERP differences as a function of checkerboard size and the classical P3b ERP component as an indicator of cognitive processing. Results We found an early (100\u2013200 ms after stimulus onset) occipital ERP effect of checkerboard size (dominant spatial frequency). This effect was weaker in the Asperger than in the control observers. Further a typical parietal/central oddball-P3b occurred at 500 ms with the rare checkerboards. The P3b showed a right-hemispheric lateralization, which was more prominent in Asperger than in control observers. Discussion The difference in the early occipital ERP effect between the two groups may be a physiological marker of differences in the processing of small visual details in Asperger observers compared to normal controls. The stronger lateralization of the P3b in Asperger observers may indicate a stronger involvement of the right-hemispheric network of bottom-up attention. The lateralization of the P3b signal might be a compensatory consequence of the compromised early checksize effect.

{"title": "OP0339 ALTMETRIC - DOES SOCIAL MEDIA IMPACT CITATION RATE IN RHEUMATOLOGY JOURNALS?", "abstract": "Background: The coloured altmetrics donut has become a standard feature of online publications. The colours depict different online sources by which an article was mentioned, while the number in the donut, the Altmetric Score (AS), reflects the summarised attention an article has received. The Dimensions database joins citations from any kind of scientific or mainstream publication. Studies analysing the link between the AS and the citation rate of an article suggest that this connection is strongly dependent on the field of research, the type of article and the type of analysis used. Objectives: To analyse the connection between AS and citation rate in articles published in rheumatology journals. Methods: We retrieved data on article usage, AS and citations of articles published in ARD and RMD Open between January 2015 and November 2019. For time-dependent analyses on the influence of AS on citations, articles published in 2019 were excluded. Forward-stepwise regression models were used to explore factors influencing total citation rates. We performed subanalyses, dividing articles in categories of correspondence, original research and editorials/viewpoints. We dichotomised articles by reaching the top 25% in terms of citation count within the first, second, third and fourth year after publication according their category. We explored the risk of reaching these top 25% in dependency of AS using logistic regression (log transformed AS) and receiver operating curve analyses . Results: We used 1597 articles published in ARD and 409 articles of RMD Open with complete data on AS and article usage within the mentioned timeframe. AS are higher in more recently published articles (p=0.04, s: 1.3 per year), but the number of Dimensions citations is lower in more recently published articles (s: -8.5 per year, p\u22640.001). Twitter shows by far the highest activity among the AS subcategories . The total number of twitter mentions increased by 2.8/year from 2015 to 2019, indicating that more recently published articles were more often picked up on twitter. Changes in R2 in the regression model indicated that besides time since publication and AS, also the type of article influences citation count. For original research and editorials, AS may significantly add to the variability of the citation count, which was not the case for correspondences. The influence of AS on citation count of editorials added 16% to the 12% variability explained by publication time. Both factors showed similar s-coefficients . This effect was smaller in original articles . AS significantly coincides with reaching the top 25% of citation counts according to time since publication. For the first year those articles with AS >15 showed a positive Likelihood Ratio (+LR; 95%CI) of 1.6 (1.4-1.9) to reach the top 25%, the second year AS>15: +LR: 1.9 (1.6-2.2), the third year AS>13: +LR 2.3 (1.9-2.7) and in the fourth year AS>12 +LR: 2.1 (1.7-2.7). This effect was again different between publication categories, with no effect of AS in correspondence articles.

A Report from the GFM", "abstract": "Introduction Isolated trisomy 8 is a frequent cytogenetic abnormality in MDS, but hematological characteristics of MDS with isolated trisomy 8 have not been reported in detail. Patients and Methods This was a retrospective analysis of cases of MDS with isolated trisomy 8 diagnosed in 6 French centers of the Groupe Francophone des Myelodysplasies (GFM) between 2003 and 2013. Only patients with isolated trisomy 8 diagnosed as MDS or MPN/MDS (other than CMML) according to WHO were eligible, excluding AML, well characterized MPN (PV, ET) and CMML. Myeloproliferative (MP) features were defined by repeated presence (in the absence of infection) of one of the following: WBC > 10G/L, circulating immature granulocytes (myelemia ) > 2%, or palpable splenomegaly. Results 103 patients with isolated trisomy 8 were identified, with a median age of 75 years, and M/F 1.7. At diagnosis, median WBC count was 4.1 G/L, with WBC \u2265 10 G/L in 13 patients (12.6 %), myelemia \u2265 2% in 27 patients (26.2 %), palpable splenomegaly in 9 patients (8.7 %).

P53 is a transcription factor for the miR34s, and overexpression of miR34s in p53 deficient cells can reinstate p53 functions . However, in cellular senescence miR34a may be activated independently of p53 . A recent multicenter study shows that in diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL), TP53 disruption is still a negative prognostic factor for survival after the implementation of Rituximab . Information on the role of the miR34s in normal CD19+ B-cells (PBL-B), activated B-cells, and de novo diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) is limited. Aims Given that MIR34A and MIR34B/C locate to regions of allelic loss in DLBCL (1p36.23 and 11q23.1, respectively), and the importance of the miR34 targets in DLBCL pathogenesis, we investigated a large panel of newly diagnosed cases of DLBCLs for MIR34A and MIR34B/C promoter methylation, TP53 mutational status, clinical presentation patterns, and outcome. Methods MIR34A/B/C promotor methylation was performed by MsMCA and bisulfite sequencing. Histone modifcations at the MIR34A/B/C promotor was examined by ChIP RT-qPCR. Expression of miR34s was performed using miRCURY LNA\u2122 Universal RT-qPCR. The coding sequences and splice sites of exons 5-9 of the TP53 gene were scanned for mutations by PCR and denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE). Differences in clinical characteristics using the one-way Anova, the Pearson chi-square, or Fisher\u2019s exact tests. Overall survival was estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method and log-rank test. For assessment of independent predictors of survival a multivariate Cox regression hazard model with backward stepwise (likelihood ratio) entry was applied. Effects not meeting a p-value < 0.05 were removed from the model. Results We show that only miR34a-5p is expressed in PBL-B, and significantly induced in activated B-cells ( P =0.017) and reactive lymph nodes ( P 3 years, while all but one of those Rituximab treated patients with concommitant disruption of TP53 and MIR34A died within the first 13 months from diagnosis.

{"title": "Is \u201cconsensus value\u201d a correct term for the product of pooling measurement results?", "abstract": "We often pool measurement results (entry 2.9 in ) and expect somehow a more adequate value from such an operation, especially in two cases. In the process leading to a certified reference material, CRM (entry 5.14 in ), we frequently pool various measurement results obtained by various measurement procedures (sometimes in various laboratories) expecting to come closer to a more adequate value for embodiment in the CRM than just the one value obtained by one measurement laboratory only. By a more adequate value, we mean a value that makes the CRM into a more reliable tool to assist in calibration or in the search of compensation for systematic effects (entry 2.17 in ) in a measurement. In a Proficiency Testing Scheme , we frequently pool various measurement results obtained by possibly various measurement procedures, expecting to establish a more adequate \u2018\u2018reference value\u2019\u2019 (entry 5.18 in ) for the Scheme than just the one value obtained by one measurement laboratory only. Again, by more adequate, we mean a value that makes a reference value in a PTS into a more reliable tool to assist in the evaluation of the performance of the PTS participants, that is, of their \u2018\u2018measurement capability\u2019\u2019 (concept 7.3\u20131 in ). Thus, in both cases, we expect that pooling measurement results enables us to come closer to a more adequate value for its intended use. But what is the thinking underlying the pooling of multiple measurement results? There is this overwhelming belief that the greater the number of measurement results we pool, the better the resulting mean value. But, in an ILC with the purpose of arriving at a reliable value for certification, the goal is different from that in a PTS: detecting unknown systematic effects. Let us analyse the application of that thinking a little deeper. First, one would think that the individual measurement results of a set of results obtained by different analysts by definition includes a measurement uncertainty (entry 2.26 in ). All of them are intended to assist somehow in the certification of a CRM and therefore ought to be reliable, in principle, within their respective stated measurement uncertainty. One would expect such results to be metrologically compatible (entry 2.47 in ) even if obtained through possibly different measurement procedures, reference measurement procedures, or even primary reference measurement procedures (entries 2.6\u20132.7\u20132.8 in ). One would even expect that these results are metrologically equivalent, that is, that they are \u2018\u2018acceptable for the same specified intended use\u2019\u2019 (concept 5\u20134 in ). The question then arises whether we indeed need multiple results for the same measurand (entry 2.3 in ). As they should all be equivalent in the sense of the definition, we could logically conclude that one of these results\u2014with its measurement uncertainty\u2014is sufficient to attribute a trustworthy value to the measurand, thus making the other values superfluous. So, what could be the point of having multiple results? The answer seems to be that these additional\u2014if superfluous\u2014 values do offer confirmation of each other, thus making all Disclaimer: The author is a member of the Joint Committee on Guides for Metrology (JCGM), Working Group 2 (VIM).

{"title": "Are hippos Africa's most influential megaherbivore? A review of ecosystem engineering by the semi-aquatic common hippopotamus.", "abstract": "Megaherbivores perform vital ecosystem engineering roles, and have their last remaining stronghold in Africa. Of Africa's remaining megaherbivores, the common hippopotamus (Hippopotamus amphibius) has received the least scientific and conservation attention, despite how influential their ecosystem engineering activities appear to be. Given the potentially crucial ecosystem engineering influence of hippos, as well as mounting conservation concerns threatening their long-term persistence, a review of the evidence for hippos being ecosystem engineers, and the effects of their engineering, is both timely and necessary. In this review, we assess, (i) aspects of hippo biology that underlie their unique ecosystem engineering potential; (ii) evaluate hippo ecological impacts in terrestrial and aquatic environments; (iii) compare the ecosystem engineering influence of hippos to other extant African megaherbivores; (iv) evaluate factors most critical to hippo conservation and ecosystem engineering; and (v) highlight future research directions and challenges that may yield new insights into the ecological role of hippos, and of megaherbivores more broadly. We find that a variety of key life-history traits determine the hippo's unique influence, including their semi-aquatic lifestyle, large body size, specialised gut anatomy, muzzle structure, small and partially webbed feet, and highly gregarious nature. On land, hippos create grazing lawns that contain distinct plant communities and alter fire spatial extent, which shapes woody plant demographics and might assist in maintaining fire-sensitive riverine vegetation. In water, hippos deposit nutrient-rich dung, stimulating aquatic food chains and altering water chemistry and quality, impacting a host of different organisms. Hippo trampling and wallowing alters geomorphological processes, widening riverbanks, creating new river channels, and forming gullies along well-utilised hippo paths. Taken together, we propose that these myriad impacts combine to make hippos Africa's most influential megaherbivore, specifically because of the high diversity and intensity of their ecological impacts compared with other megaherbivores, and because of their unique capacity to transfer nutrients across ecosystem boundaries, enriching both terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems. Nonetheless, water pollution and extraction for agriculture and industry, erratic rainfall patterns and human-hippo conflict, threaten hippo ecosystem engineering and persistence. Therefore, we encourage greater consideration of the unique role of hippos as ecosystem engineers when considering the functional importance of megafauna in African ecosystems, and increased attention to declining hippo habitat and populations, which if unchecked could change the way in which many African ecosystems function.", "DOI": "10.1111/brv.12960", "len_ids": "131-263-916-797-705", "subject": ["General Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology", "General Agricultural and Biological Sciences"]}

{"title": "D-Serine: a key to synaptic plasticity?", "abstract": "Two discoveries have put D-serine in the spotlight of neuroscience. First, D-serine was detected in brain tissue at high levels. Second, it was found to act on the N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor (NMDAR). This receptor is central to use-dependent synaptic plasticity, the cellular process which is widely believed to underlie learning. The ensuing quest for the mechanisms of D-serine synthesis, release and clearance, as well as for its physiological significance has provided a wealth of experimental evidence implicating D-serine in synaptic plasticity. However some key questions remain unanswered. Which cells release D-serine and upon what stimuli? Is D-serine supply dynamically regulated? What is the fate of released D-serine? Answering these questions appears to be an essential step in our understanding of how NMDARs trigger synaptic plasticity and learning.

Epigenetically regulated environmental sex determination is a mechanism by which species can modulate their breeding strategies to accommodate environmental change. Growing evidence suggests that epigenetic mechanisms may play a key role in phenotypic plasticity and in the rapid adaptation of species to environmental change, through the capacity of organisms to maintain a non-genetic plastic memory of the environmental and ecological conditions experienced by their parents. However, inherited epigenetic variation could also be maladaptive, becoming an epigenetic trap.

Remaining methane may be converted by methane-oxidizing bacteria to organic carbon, which is then available for heterotrophic growth and may ultimately contribute to invertebrate growth. We investigated the presence of invertebrates at a waterworks with incomplete methane removal and at a waterworks without methane. Microscopy and analyses of 16S and 18S ribosomal genes were conducted on filter sand from full-scale biological rapid sand filters. Primary filters with methane were dominated by methane- and ammonia-oxidizing bacteria. Upper layers of secondary filters were dominated by heterotrophic bacteria, while the deepest layer contained 92% eukaryote DNA. Rotifers, nematodes, platyhelminths and annelids constituted 22% of the DNA in the secondary filters. Filters with methane contained higher shares of invertebrates (13%) than the filter without methane (7%).

{"title": "Are Machine Learning Models on Wrist Accelerometry Robust against Differences in Physical Performance among Older Adults?", "abstract": "Sufficient physical activity (PA) reduces the risk of a myriad of diseases and preserves physical capabilities in later life. While there have been significant achievements in mapping accelerations to real-life movements using machine learning (ML), errors continue to be common, particularly for wrist-worn devices. It remains unknown whether ML models are robust for estimating age-related loss of physical function. In this study, we evaluated the performance of ML models (XGBoost and LASSO) to estimate the hallmark measures of PA in low physical performance (LPP) and high physical performance (HPP) groups. Our models were built to recognize PA types and intensities, identify each individual activity, and estimate energy expenditure (EE) using wrist-worn accelerometer data (33 activities per participant) from a large sample of participants . Results indicated that the ML models were accurate in recognizing PA by type and intensity while also estimating EE accurately. However, the models built to recognize individual activities were less robust. Across all tasks, XGBoost outperformed LASSO. XGBoost obtained F1-Scores for sedentary (0.932 \u00b1 0.005), locomotion (0.946 \u00b1 0.003), lifestyle (0.927 \u00b1 0.006), and strength flexibility exercise (0.915 \u00b1 0.017) activity type recognition tasks. The F1-Scores for recognizing low, light, and moderate activity intensity were (0.932 \u00b1 0.005), (0.840 \u00b1 0.004), and (0.869 \u00b1 0.005), respectively. The root mean square error for EE estimation was 0.836 \u00b1 0.059 METs. There was no evidence showing that splitting the participants into the LPP and HPP groups improved the models\u2019 performance on estimating the hallmark measures of physical activities. In conclusion, using features derived from wrist-worn accelerometer data, machine learning models can accurately recognize PA types and intensities and estimate EE for older adults with high and low physical function.", "DOI": "10.3390/s22083061", "len_ids": "074-306-879-291-925", "subject": ["Analytical Chemistry", "Biochemistry", "Electrical and Electronic Engineering", "Atomic and Molecular Physics, and Optics"]}
{"title": "Nano-Immunomodulation: A New Strategy for Skeletal Muscle Diseases and Aging?", "abstract": "The skeletal muscle has a very remarkable ability to regenerate upon injury under physiological conditions; however, this regenerative capacity is strongly diminished in physio-pathological conditions, such as those present in diseased or aged muscles. Many muscular dystrophies (MDs) are characterized by aberrant inflammation due to the deregulation of both the lymphoid and myeloid cell populations and the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines. Pathological inflammation is also observed in old muscles due to a systemic change in the immune system, known as \"inflammaging\". Immunomodulation represents, therefore, a promising therapeutic opportunity for different skeletal muscle conditions. However, the use of immunomodulatory drugs in the clinics presents several caveats, including their low stability in vivo, the need for high doses to obtain therapeutically relevant effects, and the presence of strong side effects. Within this context, the emerging field of nanomedicine provides the powerful tools needed to control the immune response. Nano-scale materials are currently being explored as biocarriers to release immunomodulatory agents in the damaged tissues, allowing therapeutic doses with limited off-target effects. In addition, the intrinsic immunomodulatory properties of some nanomaterials offer further opportunities for intervention that still need to be systematically explored. Here we exhaustively review the state-of-the-art regarding the use of nano-sized materials to modulate the aberrant immune response that characterizes some physio-pathological muscle conditions, such as MDs or sarcopenia . Based on our learnings from cancer and immune tolerance induction, we also discuss further opportunities, challenges, and limitations of the emerging field of nano-immunomodulation.", "DOI": "10.3390/ijms24021175", "len_ids": "158-249-619-494-619", "subject": ["Inorganic Chemistry", "Spectroscopy", "General Medicine", "Physical and Theoretical Chemistry", "Catalysis", "Molecular Biology", "Computer Science Applications", "Organic Chemistry"]}

{"title": "Can omic tools help generate alternative newer sources of edible seed oil?", "abstract": "There are three pathways for triacylglycerol (TAG) biosynthesis: De novo TAG biosynthesis, phosphatidylcholine-derived biosynthesis, and cytosolic TAG biosynthesis. Variability in fatty acid composition is mainly associated with phosphatidylcholine-derived TAG pathway. Mobilization of TAG-formed through cytosolic pathway into lipid droplets is yet unknown. There are multiple regulatory checkpoints starting from acetyl-CoA carboxylase to the lipid droplet biogenesis in TAG biosynthesis. Although a primary metabolism, only a few species synthesize oil in seeds for storage, and less than 10 species are commercially exploited. To meet out the growing demand for oil, diversifying into newer sources is the only choice left. The present review highlights the potential strategies targeting species like Azadirachta, Callophyllum, Madhuca, Moringa, Pongamia, Ricinus, and Simarouba, which are not being used for eating but are otherwise high yielding  with seeds having a high oil content (40-60%). Additionally, understanding the toxin biosynthesis in Ricinus and Simarouba would be useful in developing toxin-free oil plants.

Recently, HbA1c testing has been included within the diagnostic criteria recommended for diagnosis of diabetes in nonpregnant individuals by the American Diabetes Association (ADA). The emerging concept that HbA1c can be used rather than blood glucose in the diagnosis of diabetes is highly appealing for a variety of reasons, including less sensitivity to preanalytical variables, lower within subject biological variability, little to null interference from diurnal variations, acute stress and common drugs which are known to influence glucose metabolism, as well as the fact that one single measurement might provide information for both diagnosing diabetes and tracking glycemic control. On the other hand, the use of HbA1c for screening and diagnosing diabetes also carries some limitations, including the worse diagnostic performance in different populations , the risk of overdiagnosis in subjects with iron deficiency anemia, in subjects genetically predisposed to hyperglycation, and in those with increased red blood cell turnover. There is also a higher risk of misdiagnosis in patients with end-stage renal disease and heavy alcohol consumption. Finally, HbA1c testing might be biased due to the interference from several hemoglobin variants, is characterized by a higher imprecision than blood glucose measurement, and is more expensive. This paper will critically summarize the potential advantages and limitations of HbA1c as a recommended test for diagnosing diabetes.", "DOI": "10.1515/cclm.2010.144", "len_ids": "101-864-796-982-740", "subject": ["General Medicine", "Clinical Biochemistry", "Biochemistry (medical)", "Biochemistry, medical"]}

However, there is a concern about whether the P adsorption process will contribute to substrate clogging.

RESULTS: Contributions of individual processes to clogging from biosolids production (SBS), inert matter generated from the conversion of residual biomass (SIS), P adsorption (SP) and inert matter production from influent total suspended solids (SSS) during operation of the two systems were assessed. After 262\u2009days of operation, results indicated that SBS contributed most (53.16\u2009\u00b1\u20097.73%) to the clogging, followed by SSS (41.48\u2009\u00b1\u20098.02%), SP (3.14\u2009\u00b1\u20090.06%) and SIS (2.20\u2009\u00b1\u20090.27%) when treating the influent with concentrations of 284\u2013558\u2009mg\u2009L\u207b\u00b9 for COD, 54\u2013197\u2009mg\u2009L\u207b\u00b9 for SS and 5\u201313\u2009mg\u2009L\u207b\u00b9 for P.

During an initial period (1993\u20132004), the diet was essentially composed of invertebrates such as common aquatic insects (correlated with flooding) or Eristalis larvae picked from the mud , while scraps of meat taken from rubbish dumps were minor. These traditional preys taken from the same ecosystems as in its native area did not result in an exponential increase of the number of breeding Sacred ibises. Invasive Red swamp crayfish recently replaced other foods in its diet with a resulting sharp increase in breeding pair numbers ( R 2 \u00a0=\u00a00.48). As in other parts of the world, vertebrates constituted very accidental preys, and no bird species were really threatened by such predation. Conversely, the Sacred ibis can have a positive effect as a predator of invasive crayfish.

{"title": "Subcellular compartmentalization of ceramide metabolism: MAM (mitochondria-associated membrane) and/or mitochondria?", "abstract": "Recent studies by our group and others have disclosed the presence of ceramides in mitochondria, and the activities of ceramide synthase and reverse ceramidase in mitochondria have also been reported. Since a possible contamination with the ER (endoplasmic reticulum)-related compartment MAM (mitochondria-associated membrane) could not be ruled out in previous studies, we have re-investigated the presence of the enzymes of ceramide metabolism in mitochondria and MAM highly purified from rat liver. In the present paper, we show that purified mitochondria as well as MAM are indeed able to generate ceramide in vitro through both ceramide synthase or reverse ceramidase, whereas the latter enzyme activity is barely detectable in microsomes. Moreover, ceramide synthase activities were recovered in outer mitochondrial membranes as well as in inner mitochondrial membranes. Using radiolabelled sphingosine as a substrate, mitochondria could generate ceramide and phytoceramide. However, the in vitro sensitivity of ceramide synthase toward FB1 (fumonisin B1) in mitochondria as well as in MAM was found to depend upon the sphingoid base: whereas dihydrosphingosine N-acyltransferase was inhibited by FB1 in a concentration-dependent manner, FB1 actually activated the ceramide synthase when using sphingosine as a substrate. Acylation of sphingosine 1-phosphate and dihydrosphingosine 1-phosphate, generating ceramide 1-phosphate, was also shown with both subcellular fractions. Moreover, the same difference in sensitivity towards FB1 for the ceramide synthase activities was seen between the two phosphorylated sphingoid bases, raising the possibility that distinct base-specific enzymes may be involved as ceramide synthases. Collectively, these results demonstrate the involvement of mitochondria in the metabolism of ceramides through different pathways, thereby supporting the hypothesis that topology of ceramide formation could determine its function.", "DOI": "10.1042/bj20031819", "len_ids": "086-294-115-068-969", "subject": ["Cell Biology", "Molecular Biology", "Biochemistry"]}

In an effort to bridge the information gap between theory and experiment we have undertaken an ab initio study of substituted oxirenes. Predictions at various levels of theory up to the double-[zeta] plus polarization single and double coupled cluster with perturbative triples correction [DZP CCSD(T)] are presented for the series of substituted oxirenes with the formula X[sub 2]C[sub 2]O, where X = BH[sub 2], CH[sub 3], NH[sub 2], OH, and F.

{"title": "Targeting tumor interstitial fluid pressure: will it yield novel successful therapies for solid tumors?", "abstract": "Introduction: Elevated tumor interstitial fluid pressure (TIFP) is a major barrier to successful cancer treatment. It is mainly caused by an inadequate tumor perfusion resulting from missing lymphatic vessels, a leaky and immature tumor vasculature, an overly stimulated angiogenesis, and interstitial fibrosis. TIFP hampers convection-driven fluid transport within tumors and causes inefficient penetration and distribution of anti-neoplastic drugs.Areas covered: This review covers mechanisms and regulation of TIFP and gives an overview of strategies to overcome this barrier.Expert opinion: Increased TIFP occurs in vivo and hence may be overlooked in molecular biology-driven cancer research. Its pervasiveness means that it can reduce the effectiveness of anti-neoplastic drugs. This is often misinterpreted as drug resistance; it precedes all drug resistance mechanisms operating at the cell level. The key challenge in the field of cancer therapeutics is to find ways to lower TIFP. Several drug therapies have been tried but none of them have had an impact in the clinic.

Even with the best supportive care, the mortality rate in the most severe cases is 40-50%, and the only pharmacological agent shown to be of possible benefit has been steroids. Mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) have been tested in several pre-clinical models of lung injury and been found to have significant therapeutic benefit related to: (a) potent immunomodulation; (b) secretion of epithelial and endothelial growth factors; and (c) augmentation of host defense to infection. Initial translational efforts have shown signs of promise, but the results have not yielded the anticipated outcomes. One potential reason is the relatively low survival of MSCs in inflammatory conditions as shown in several studies. Therefore, strategies to boost the survival of MSCs are needed to enhance their therapeutic effect. Protease-activated receptors (PARs) may represent one such possibility as they are G-protein coupled receptors expressed by MSCs and control several facets of cell behavior.

{"title": "Exploring holocene changes in palynological richness in northern Europe--did postglacial immigration matter?", "abstract": "In mid to high latitudes glacial and interglacial cycles have repeatedly changed the area available for plant growth. The speed at which plants are able to colonize areas at the onset of an interglacial is hypothesized to limit their distribution ranges even today (migrational lag). If the spread of plants would have been generally slow then plant diversity in previously glaciated areas would be expected to increase over time. We explore this hypothesis using results from six palynological investigations from two previously glaciated regions: central Sweden and north-eastern Germany. Rarefaction, slope of rank order abundance, and taxa accumulation plots were used to evaluate richness and evenness in pollen data in an attempt to separate richness from evenness. These analyses show little change in palynological richness for the northern sites throughout the Holocene. In contrast, the southern sites show an increase in richness and evenness during the early Holocene; this may be explained by the different initial conditions at the onset of the Holocene. A strong rise in palynological richness around 6000 and 1000 years ago at the southern sites can be attributed to the regional initiation of agriculture and major opening of the forest, respectively. For the northern sites there is no evidence for increased taxonomic diversity through time that could be due to delayed immigration of species.", "DOI": "10.1371/journal.pone.0051624", "len_ids": "007-711-516-230-815", "subject": ["General Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology", "General Medicine", "Multidisciplinary", "General Agricultural and Biological Sciences"]}

Previous acute coronary syndromes (7.5%), stable angina (5%), cerebrovascular accidents (7.5%), transient ischaemic attacks (2.5%), lower limb claudication(5%) and digital gangrene(5%) were documented. There were no current or ex-smokers. 72.5% had hypertension, 32.5% had dyslipidemias and 25% had diabetes. 40% were obese and 20% overweight (Asian cutoffs). 30% had elevated CRP. The LN patients were in Class I- 2.5%, II-12.5%, III-20%, IV-60%, V-5%. Nephrotic range proteinuria was present in 32% and chronic kidney disease (CKD) was present in 52% of patients . CIMT was considered increased if more than the 75th percentile based on cutoffs from the \u201cCarotid Atherosclerosis Progression Study\u201d. Increased CIMT (57.5%) and atherosclerotic plaques (15 36%) indicate a high CVD risk in this cohort. Diabetes (p=0.016), hypertension (p=0.002), dyslipdemia (p=0.002) and obesity (p=0.048) independently correlated with increased CIMT. Increased CIMT and plaques were not associated with high CRP or high current disease activity. A higher CIMT was observed with a significantly high cardiovascular (p=0.018) and peripheral vascular index (p=0.016) but not withproteinuria >3.5g/24h or estimated GFR Conclusions This LN cohort had varied organ involvement and a high prevalence of conventional CVD risk factors. Nephrotic range proteinuria and CKD did not confer an independently increased risk of CVD in cohort. The increased CVD risk prevalent was attributed to increased prevalence of conventional risk factors.

{"title": "Can we approach the gas\u2013liquid critical point using slab simulations of two coexisting phases?", "abstract": "In this paper, we demonstrate that it is possible to approach the gas\u2013liquid critical point of the Lennard-Jones fluid by performing simulations in a slab geometry using a cut-off potential. In the slab simulation geometry, it is essential to apply an accurate tail correction to the potential energy, applied during the course of the simulation, to study the properties of states close to the critical point. Using the Janecek slab-based method developed for two-phase Monte Carlo simulations [J. Janecek, J. Chem. Phys. 131, 6264 (2006)], the coexisting densities and surface tension in the critical region are reported as a function of the cutoff distance in the intermolecular potential. The results obtained using slab simulations are compared with those obtained using grand canonical Monte Carlo simulations of isotropic systems and the finite-size scaling techniques. There is a good agreement between these two approaches. The two-phase simulations can be used in approaching the critical point for temperature...", "DOI": "10.1063/1.4962820", "len_ids": "069-472-351-132-558", "subject": ["General Physics and Astronomy", "Physical and Theoretical Chemistry"]}

Studies from different part of the world have shown the combination to be associated with higher incidence of complications of cirrhosis and reduced survival. However, data on the impact of pre-cirrhotic and post-cirrhotic diabetes on cirrhosis is minimal. Aim The aim of the study was to determine the complications of cirrhosis patients with and without co-existent DM and to compare the relation between cirrhosis patients with antecedent DM and hepatogenous DM. Materials and Methods The present prospective study was conducted at a tertiary care hospital in Kerala, India, over a period of three years. Cirrhosis patients with and without diabetes, along with subcategorization as antecedent and hepatogenous diabetes, were studied for various complications and outcome including death. Chi-square and Mann-whitney tests were used for comparing data. Results Patients with cirrhosis and diabetes had higher incidence of gall stones (27.6% versus 13.2%; p=0.008) and urinary infection (29.3% versus 7.5%; p=<0.001). Incidence of hepatocellular carcinoma and mortality were similar between the groups. Patients with antecedent diabetes and hepatogenous diabetes were similar with respect to complications and mortality. Child-Turcotte-Pugh (CTP) score, Model for End stage Liver Disease (MELD) score, urinary tract and respiratory infections and duration of cirrhosis were independent predictors of mortality in patients with cirrhosis.

The analysis is most appropriate for relatively low temperatures, where lattice diffusion of the solute (more reactive element) cannot assist in the formation of an external oxide over any reasonable time scale. It is suggested that over a range of po2 values, the transition will occur at a roughly constant alloy composition corresponding to a continuum percolation requirement for a nanoscale skeletal oxide formed just below the alloy surface. When this oxide has a sufficiently connected morphology, it provides a short-circuit transport path for the solute. Removal of compressive stress by movement of solvent to the surface is discussed.

{"title": "Can uterine secretion of modified histones alter blastocyst implantation, embryo nutrition, and transgenerational phenotype?", "abstract": "Extracellular histones support rodent and human embryo development in at least two ways. First, these molecules in uterine secretions protect embryos from inflammation caused by pathogens that gain access to the reproductive tract. Also, histones in uterine secretions likely support penetration of the uterine epithelium by blastocysts during embryo implantation. Extracellular histones seem to preserve amino acid transport system B0,+ in blastocysts by inhibiting its activity. Preservation of system B0,+ is needed because, at the time of invasion of the uterine epithelium by motile trophoblasts, system B0,+ is likely reactivated to help remove tryptophan from the implantation chamber. If tryptophan is not removed, T-cells proliferate and reject the implanting blastocyst. Epigenetic modification of histones could alter their promotion of normal implantation through, say, incomplete tryptophan removal and, thus, allow partial T-cell rejection of the conceptus. Such partial rejection could impair placental development, embryonal/fetal nutrition, and weight gain prior to birth. Small-for-gestational-age offspring are predisposed to developing metabolic syndrome, obesity, and associated complications as adults. Shifting expression of these phenotypes might contribute to transgenerational variation and evolution. The spectrum of possible extracellular histone targets in early development warrant new research, especially since the effects of epigenetic histone modifications might be transgenerational.", "DOI": "10.1515/bmc-2018-0017", "len_ids": "078-377-662-881-362", "subject": ["General Medicine", "Cellular and Molecular Neuroscience", "General Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"]}

A prototype scanning system was developed for this study. This system combined hyperspectral cameras and a three-dimensional LiDAR, mounted on a pan-tilt head, and a positioning system which determined the spatial location of the resultant hyperspectral data cube. This system was used to obtain scans both in the laboratory and at a gold mine in Western Australia. Samples from this mine site were assayed to determine their gold concentration and were scanned using the hyperspectral apparatus in the laboratory to create a library of labelled reference spectra. This library was used as (i) the reference set for spectral angle mapper classification and (ii) a training set for a convolutional neural network classifier. Both classification approaches were found to classify ore and waste on the scanned face with good accuracy when compared to the mine geological model. Greater resolution on the classification of ore grade quality was compromised by the quality and quantity of training data.

We present a comparative overview of commonly adopted Seebeck coefficient measurement practices. First, we examine the influence of asynchronous temporal and spatial measurement of electric potential and temperature. Temporal asynchronicity introduces error in the absolute Seebeck coefficient of the order of \u224810%, whereas spatial asynchronicity introduces error of the order of a few percent. Second, we examine the influence of poor thermal contact between the measurement probes and the sample. This is especially critical at high temperature, wherein the prevalent mode of measuring surface temperature is facilitated by pressure contact. Each topic will include the comparison of data measured using different measurement techniques and using different probe arrangements. We demonstrate that the probe arrangement is the primary limit to high accuracy, wherein the Seebeck coefficients measured by the 2-probe arrangement and those measured by the 4-probe arrangement diverge with the increase in temperature, approaching \u224814% at 900 K. Using these analyses, we provide recommended measurement protocols to guide members of the thermoelectric materials community in performing more accurate measurements and in evaluating more comprehensive uncertainty limits.", "DOI": "10.1007/s11664-015-3640-9", "len_ids": "154-184-995-418-521", "subject": ["Materials Chemistry", "Condensed Matter Physics", "Electrical and Electronic Engineering", "Electronic, Optical and Magnetic Materials"]}

{"title": "Nox, Nox, Are You There? The Role of NADPH Oxidases in the Peripheral Nervous System.", "abstract": "SIGNIFICANCE Reactive oxygen species (ROS) contribute to multiple aspects of peripheral nervous system (PNS) biology ranging from physiological processes (e.g. axonal outgrowth and regeneration), to pathophysiology (e.g. nerve degeneration). Although ROS are derived from multiple sources, NADPH oxidase (Nox) family members are dedicated to ROS generation. Noxs are expressed in the PNS and their overexpression is associated with detrimental effects on nerve function and contribute, at least in part, to peripheral neuropathies. Recent Advances: Of the 7 members, studies mostly focused on Nox1, Nox2, and Nox4, which are expressed in the PNS in a cell-specific manner. We have also recently identified human Nox5 in sural nerve biopsies. When maintained at homeostatic levels, Noxs regulate several aspects of peripheral nerve health, most notably neurite outgrowth and axonal regeneration following nerve lesion. While Nox2 and Nox4 dysregulation is a major source of oxidative stress in PNS disorders, including neuropathic pain and diabetic peripheral neuropathy, recent evidence also implicates Nox1 and Nox5. CRITICAL ISSUES Although there is compelling evidence for a direct role of Noxs on nerve function, little is known about their subcellular localization, intercellular regulation, and interaction. These, together with redox signaling, are considered crucial components of nerve redox status. Additionally, the lack of isoform-specific inhibitors limits conclusions about the physiological role of Noxs in the PNS and their therapeutic potential in peripheral neuropathies. FUTURE DIRECTIONS Future research using isoform-specific genetic and pharmacological approaches are therefore needed to better understand the significance of Nox enzymes in PNS (patho) physiology.", "DOI": "10.1089/ars.2021.0135", "len_ids": "055-260-878-513-688", "subject": ["Clinical Biochemistry", "General Earth and Planetary Sciences", "Cell Biology", "Physiology", "General Environmental Science", "Molecular Biology", "Biochemistry"]}

A chronic therapy with glucocorticoids (GC) is one of the main risk for their development. Due to the severe impairment of the quality of life they could cause, prevention and treatment of OP is a central issue in the management of SLE. Objectives In this work we aimed at evaluating (i) the prevalence of OP and clinically evident FFx in a cohort of SLE patients under chronic GC therapy, (ii) the presence of some additional risk factors with identification of possible strategies to improve their quality of care. Methods The following data were retrospectively collected from clinical charts of SLE patients under regular follow up: age, sex, menopausal status (MP), Body Mass Index, smoking habits, disease duration, daily dose and cumulative GC, presence and type of organ involvement, comorbidities and concomitant medications potentially affecting bone metabolism. Bone Mineral Density (BMD) scores, presence of FFx, phosphocalcic metabolism, supplementation with calcium and vitamin D and therapy with bisphosphonates (BPs) were also recorded. BMD of lumbar spine and non-dominant hip was measured by DXA and expressed as T-scores and in g/cm 2 . OP was defined according to the World Health Organization. Only FFx occurring after the onset of SLE and unrelated to trauma were included. Univariate and multivariate logistic regression were used to analyze the associations of both OP and FFx with possible risk factors. Results One hundred and eighty six patients  were included into the analysis. The mean BMI value was 23,95 kg/m 2 , 56 (30.1%) were smokers, 68 (36.8%) had a thyroid disorder, 61 women (34.9%) were MP and 26 patients (14%) had a CRF. All patients have been treated with GC: mean daily dose of 5-4\u00b12.3 mg and mean cumulative dose of 34.9\u00b125.3 g (prednisone equivalent). At their last visit, 97 patients (52.2%) had a reduced BMD and 52 (27.9%) had OP. At least one FFx was recorded in 22 out of 186 patients (11.8%); patients with FFx were all women and 6 (27.3%) were pre-menopausal; in 16 cases more than one FFx were present, for a total of 40 fractures. Univariate analysis showed a correlation between OP and age, cumulative dose of GC, MP, therapy with AEDs and with CRF  CRF and a chronic treatment with AC or AEDs seem to be associated with a higher risk profile for OP and FFx in these patients. Thus, these variables should be considered for a patient9s tailored risk stratification and, eventually, for a stricter monitoring or more aggressive treatment strategies.

Batch and Continuous Studies Using Submerged Anaerobic Membrane Bioreactors (SAMBRs)", "abstract": "This study investigated fundamental mechanisms that anaerobic biomass employ to cope with salinity, and applied these findings to a continuous SAMBR. When anaerobic biomass was exposed to 20 and 40 g NaCl/L for 96 h, the main solute generated de novo by biomass was trehalose. When we separately introduced trehalose, N-acetyl-\u03b2-lysine and potassium into a batch culture a slight decrease in sodium inhibition was observed. In contrast, the addition of 0.1 mM and 1 mM of glycine betaine dramatically improved the adaptation of anaerobic biomass to 35 g NaCl/L, and it continued to enhance the adaptation of biomass to the salt for the next three batch feedings without further addition. No shift in archaeal microbial diversity was found when anaerobic biomass was exposed in batch mode to 35 g NaCl/L for 360 h, and no changes were found when glycine betaine was added. The dominant species identified under these conditions were Methanosarcina mazeii and Methanosaeta sp. The addition of 5 mM glycine betaine to a continuous SAMBR at 12 h hydraulic retention time (HRT), and operation in batch mode for 2 days can significantly enhance saline (35 g NaCl/L) synthetic sewage degradation. In addition, the injection of 1 mM of glycine betaine into a SAMBR for five subsequent days also significantly enhanced dissolved organic carbon (DOC) removal from sewage under these conditions. The main compatible solutes generated by anaerobic biomass after 44 days exposure to 35 g NaCl/L in a SAMBR were N-acetyl-\u03b2-lysine and glycine betaine. Finally, the addition of 1 mM glycine betaine to the medium was beneficial for anaerobic biomass in batch mode at 20 \u00b0C under saline and non saline conditions.", "DOI": "10.1021/es903981k", "len_ids": "096-678-949-425-315", "subject": ["Environmental Chemistry", "General Chemistry"]}

Our goal was to test whether protection was responsible for density dynamics in this protection gradient, and whether a hunting moratorium impacted herbivore densities during the studies. For all four species, we estimated lower densities in partially protected buffer areas adjacent to SLNP  compared to protected parklands. Density trends through the study period were species-specific, with some species increasing, decreasing, or remaining stable in all or some regions of the protection gradient. Surprisingly, when controlling for other covariates, we found that these observed differences were not always detectably related to the level of protection or year. Our findings highlight the importance of accounting for variables beyond strata of interest in evaluating the effectiveness of a protected area.

While there are few preliminary studies addressing the usage of these models in virtual screening, none of them focus on the prospect of hit-finding in a real-world virtual screen with a model based on low prior structural information. In order to address this, we have developed an AlphaFold2 version where we exclude all structural templates with more than 30% sequence identity from the model-building process.

{"title": "Evidence of Partial Migration in a Large Coastal Predator: Opportunistic Foraging and Reproduction as Key Drivers?", "abstract": "Understanding animal movement decisions that involve migration is critical for evaluating population connectivity, and thus persistence. Recent work on sharks has shown that often only a portion of the adult population will undertake migrations, while the rest may be resident in an area for long periods. Defining the extent to which adult sharks use specific habitats and their migratory behaviour is essential for assessing their risk of exposure to threats such as fishing and habitat degradation. The present study used acoustic telemetry to examine residency patterns and migratory behaviour of adult bull sharks (Carcharhinus leucas) along the East coast of Australia. Fifty-six VR2W acoustic receivers were used to monitor the movements of 33 bull sharks in the central Great Barrier Reef (GBR). Both males and females were detected year-round, but their abundance and residency peaked between September and December across years (2012\u20132014). High individual variability in reef use patterns was apparent, with some individuals leaving the array for long periods, whereas others (36%) exhibited medium (0.20\u20130.40) or high residency (> 0.50). A large portion of the population (51%) undertook migrations of up to 1,400 km to other coral reefs and/or inshore coastal habitats in Queensland and New South Wales. Most of these individuals (76%) were mature females, and the timing of migrations coincided with the austral summer (Dec-Feb). All migrating individuals (except one) returned to the central GBR, highlighting its importance as a potential foraging ground. Our findings suggest that adult bull sharks appear to be highly dependent on coral reef resources and provide evidence of partial migration, where only a portion of the female population undertook seasonal migrations potentially to give birth. Given that estuarine habitats face constant anthropogenic pressures, understanding partial migration and habitat connectivity of large coastal predators should be a priority for their management.", "DOI": "10.1371/journal.pone.0147608", "len_ids": "020-459-258-041-120", "subject": ["General Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology", "General Medicine", "Multidisciplinary", "General Agricultural and Biological Sciences"]}
{"title": "Does multi-way, long-range chromatin contact data advance 3D genome reconstruction?", "abstract": "Methods for inferring the three-dimensional (3D) configuration of chromatin from conformation capture assays that provide strictly pairwise interactions, notably Hi-C, utilize the attendant contact matrix as input. More recent assays, in particular split-pool recognition of interactions by tag extension (SPRITE), capture multi-way interactions instead of solely pairwise contacts. These assays yield contacts that straddle appreciably greater genomic distances than Hi-C, in addition to instances of exceptionally high-order chromatin interaction. Such attributes are anticipated to be consequential with respect to 3D genome reconstruction, a task yet to be undertaken with multi-way contact data. However, performing such 3D reconstruction using distance-based reconstruction techniques requires framing multi-way contacts as (pairwise) distances. Comparing approaches for so doing, and assessing the resultant impact of long-range and multi-way contacts, are the objectives of this study. We obtained 3D reconstructions via multi-dimensional scaling under a variety of weighting schemes for mapping SPRITE multi-way contacts to pairwise distances. Resultant configurations were compared following Procrustes alignment and relationships were assessed between associated Procrustes root mean square errors and key features such as the extent of multi-way and/or long-range contacts. We found that these features had surprisingly limited influence on 3D reconstruction, a finding we attribute to their influence being diminished by the preponderance of pairwise contacts. Distance-based 3D genome reconstruction using SPRITE multi-way contact data is not appreciably affected by the weighting scheme used to convert multi-way interactions to pairwise distances.

If feasible, surgery is the preferred treatment modality. Nevertheless, some malignancies have a tendency of recurrence, with possible distant metastasis. Alternative treatment strategies, such as primary radiation or chemotherapeutics, often present low response rates. As a result, there is an unmet need for novel therapeutic approaches. Nowadays, target-based therapies (e.g., small inhibitors and immunotherapy) are used by the medical oncologist for possible treatment of advanced SGMs. Based on recent published trials, some novel treatments may provide additional disease control for some patients. However, sample sizes are small, the general findings are unsatisfactory, and a lot of uncertainties remain to be elucidated. Nevertheless, research shows that patients do not benefit from blind administration of systemic treatments and therefore a more personalized approach is highly needed. The aim of this review paper is to summarize the most recent advances in the biological understanding and molecular pathways of salivary gland cancers, the association of these pathways with the current treatments used and their implications for more personalized targeted-based therapies.", "DOI": "10.3390/ijms232314891", "len_ids": "015-969-677-008-551", "subject": ["Inorganic Chemistry", "Spectroscopy", "General Medicine", "Physical and Theoretical Chemistry", "Catalysis", "Molecular Biology", "Computer Science Applications", "Organic Chemistry"]}

Participants read poems which could be more or less difficult in terms of conceptual or structural aspects, and which were presented in a font that was either easy or more difficult to read. Participants read existing poems and subsequently rated their subjective experience . In line with previous literature we observed a Poem Difficulty x Font Readability interaction effect for subjective measures of poetry reading. We found that participants rated easy poems as nicer when presented in an easy to read font, as compared to when presented in a hard to read font. Despite the presence of the interaction effect, we did not observe the predicted opposite effect for more difficult poems.

{"title": "Genetic polymorphisms altering microRNA activity in psoriasis \u2013 a key to solve the puzzle of missing heritability?", "abstract": "Psoriasis is a chronic immune-mediated skin disease in which the balance in the interplay of immune cells and keratinocytes is disturbed. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are endogenous small regulatory RNAs that stabilize cellular phenotypes and fine-tune signal transduction feedback loops through the regulation of gene networks. Through the regulation of their multiple target genes, miRNAs regulate the development of inflammatory cell subsets and have a significant impact on the magnitude of inflammatory responses. Since the discovery of deregulated miRNA expression in psoriasis, we have learned that they can regulate differentiation, proliferation and cytokine response of keratinocytes, activation and survival of T cells and the crosstalk between immunocytes and keratinocytes through the regulation of chemokine production. In recent years, it became apparent that genetic polymorphisms in miRNA genes and/or in miRNA binding sites of target genes can affect miRNA activity and contribute to disease susceptibility. Psoriasis has a strong genetic background; however, the contribution of genetic variants involving miRNAs is largely unexplored in psoriasis. We propose that changes in miRNA-mediated gene regulation may be a major contributor to the disturbed balance in immune regulation that results in chronic skin inflammation. In this viewpoint essay, we focus on the emerging new aspects of the role of miRNAs in psoriasis and propose that genetic polymorphisms that affect miRNA activity might be important in the pathogenesis of psoriasis.", "DOI": "10.1111/exd.12469", "len_ids": "013-562-385-042-689", "subject": ["Dermatology", "Molecular Biology", "Biochemistry"]}

The diagnosis HSP is based on clinical and histological features. HSP can occur at any age, but is most common in childhood. The etiology remains unknown, although it is quite common upper respiratory tract (URT) infections as a precedent. Objectives To describe the prevalence of the clinical manifestations in adults and children at the time of diagnosis of HSP. Methods A retrospective study of the case records of all admitted patients identified by the HSP diagnosis in the Hospital Universitario Severo Ochoa (Madrid, Spain) between January 1976 and June 2015 was undertaken. Classification criteria proposed by Michel et al were used for the diagnosis - including age Continuous data were described as mean and standard deviation (mean, SD), or median and interquartile range (IQR) and categorical variables as percentages. Means and incidence rates were compared using the Student t test. To compare categorical data we performed the chi-square test. Results We identified 51 patients, mainly male (64.7%), with a median age at the onset of symptoms of 18 (IQR 13\u201341) years old. Thirty nine were younger than 20 years old.

In an article published in this issue of FEBS Open Bio, the authors report how molecular alterations in circulating extracellular vesicles (EVs) influence social behaviours and resilience to chronic social stress. Test mice were classified as resilient or susceptible to social stress and their blood samples were analysed. Their data demonstrated that mice susceptible to CSDS have alterations in the miRNA content of circulating EVs, and these EVs in turn influence the expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines in microglia cells, thereby resulting in social avoidance phenotypes. Since low resilience to social stress may be linked to the progression of several psychiatric disorders, it may ultimately be possible to determine prognosis or likely response to therapy for individuals susceptible to or suffering from such conditions by profiling pro-inflammatory cytokines and EV-associated miRNAs in blood samples.", "DOI": "10.1002/2211-5463.13291", "len_ids": "005-583-760-387-973", "subject": ["General Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"]}

{"title": "Genetic dissection of the Arabidopsis spaceflight transcriptome: Are some responses dispensable for the physiological adaptation of plants to spaceflight?", "abstract": "Experimentation on the International Space Station has reached the stage where repeated and nuanced transcriptome studies are beginning to illuminate the structural and metabolic differences between plants grown in space compared to plants on the Earth. Genes that are important in establishing the spaceflight responses are being identified, their roles in spaceflight physiological adaptation are increasingly understood, and the fact that different genotypes adapt differently is recognized. However, the basic question of whether these spaceflight responses are actually required for survival has yet to be posed, and the fundamental notion that spaceflight responses may be non-adaptive has yet to be explored. Therefore the experiments presented here were designed to ask if portions of the plant spaceflight response can be genetically removed without causing loss of spaceflight survival and without causing increased stress responses. The CARA experiment compared the spaceflight transcriptome responses in the root tips of two Arabidopsis ecotypes, Col-0 and WS, as well as that of a PhyD mutant of Col-0. When grown with the ambient light of the ISS, phyD plants displayed a significantly reduced spaceflight transcriptome response compared to Col-0, suggesting that altering the activity of a single gene can actually improve spaceflight adaptation by reducing the transcriptome cost of physiological adaptation. The WS genotype showed an even simpler spaceflight transcriptome response in the ambient light of the ISS, more broadly indicating that the plant genotype can be manipulated to reduce the cost of spaceflight adaptation, as measured by transcriptional response. These differential genotypic responses suggest that genetic manipulation could further reduce, or perhaps eliminate the metabolic cost of spaceflight adaptation. When plants were germinated and then left in the dark on the ISS, the WS genotype actually mounted a larger transcriptome response than Col-0, suggesting that the in-space light environment affects physiological adaptation, which implies that manipulating the local habitat can also substantially impact the metabolic cost of spaceflight adaptation.", "DOI": "10.1371/journal.pone.0180186", "len_ids": "034-185-551-740-644", "subject": ["General Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology", "General Medicine", "Multidisciplinary", "General Agricultural and Biological Sciences"]}

Size-consistency has emerged as a usual ingredient to be considered, since it has to do, for example, with the capability of accurately describing subsystems which are made far apart from each other. We here revisit N-dependent self-interaction corrections (SICs), that is, which depend explicitly upon the number of electrons N and are usually classified as not consistent in size. This history has begun long before what is today called DFT, with the Fermi\u2013Amaldi SIC applied to the Thomas\u2013Fermi formalism. In this context, we here propose an investigation of a modified Fermi\u2013Amaldi approach, with the inclusion of exponents which can lead to great accuracy. We also introduce the idea of exponents written as density functionals, in order to treat, for example, ionization and dissociation processes.", "DOI": "10.1007/s00214-021-02828-8", "len_ids": "024-167-055-622-575", "subject": ["Physical and Theoretical Chemistry"]}
{"title": "Can Intraoperative Intra-Articular Loads Predict Postoperative Knee Joint Laxity Following Total Knee Arthroplasty? A Cadaver Study with Smart Tibial Trays.", "abstract": "Ligament balancing during total knee arthroplasty (TKA) often relies on subjective surgeon experience. Although instrumented tibial trays facilitate an objective assessment of intraoperative joint balance through quantification of intra-articular joint loads, postoperative clinical assessment of joint balance relies on passive stress tests quantifying varus\u2013valgus joint laxity. This study aimed at correlating the intraoperative and postoperative metrics used to assess joint balance while also comparing joint loads obtained during passive assessment and active functional motions. Four experienced surgical fellows were assigned a fresh-frozen lower limb each to plan and perform posterior-stabilised TKA. An instrumented tibial insert measured intraoperative intra-articular loads. Specimens were then subjected to passive flexion\u2013extension, open-chain extension, active squatting, and varus\u2013valgus laxity tests on a validated knee simulator. Intra-articular loads were recorded using the instrumented insert and tibiofemoral kinematics using an optical motion capture system. A negative correlation was observed between mean intraoperative intra-articular loads and corresponding mean postoperative tibial abduction angle during laxity tests ; however, this was not observed for each specimen. Peak intra-articular load distribution for active squatting was lateral-heavy, contrasting to the medial-heavy distribution observed in passive intraoperative measurements, for all specimens. These aspects should be given due consideration while assessing intraoperative and postoperative joint stability following TKA.", "DOI": "10.3390/s21155078", "len_ids": "001-125-797-664-205", "subject": ["Analytical Chemistry", "Biochemistry", "Electrical and Electronic Engineering", "Atomic and Molecular Physics, and Optics"]}

At the empirical level, we investigate nanotech industry participation in the Environmental Protection Agency\u2019s Nanoscale Materials Stewardship Program (NMSP) as an example of CSP, in order to examine the effects of company characteristics on CSP outcomes. The analysis demonstrates that, on the average, older and larger companies for which nanotech is one of the many business activities demonstrate greater CSP as judged by company actions, declarations, and self-evaluations. Such companies tended to submit more of the requested information to the NMSP, including specific information about health and safety, and to claim fewer of the submitted items as confidential business information. They were also more likely to have on-line statements of generic and nano-specific corporate social responsibility principles, policies, and achievements.

{"title": "Collision coupling, crosstalk, and compartmentalization in G-protein coupled receptor systems: can a single model explain disparate results?", "abstract": "The collision coupling model describes interactions between receptors and G-proteins as first requiring the molecules to find each other by diffusion. A variety of experimental data on G-protein activation have been interpreted as suggesting (or not) the compartmentalization of receptors and/or G-proteins in addition to a collision coupling mechanism. In this work, we use a mathematical model of G-protein activation via collision coupling but without compartmentalization to demonstrate that these disparate observations do not imply the existence of such compartments. In experiments with GTP analogs (commonly GTP\u03b3S), the extent of G-protein activation is predicted to be a function of both receptor number and the rate of GTP analog hydrolysis. The sensitivity of G-protein activation to receptor number is shown to be dependent upon the assay used, with the sensitivity of phosphate production assays (GTPase) >GTP\u03b3S-binding assays >cAMP inhibition assays. Finally, the amount of competition or crosstalk between receptor species activating the same type of G-proteins is predicted to depend on receptor and G-protein number, but in some (common) experimental regimes this dependence is expected to be minimal. Taken together, these observations suggest that the collision coupling model, without compartments of receptors and/or G-proteins, is sufficient to explain a variety of observations in literature data.", "DOI": "10.1016/j.jtbi.2008.08.003", "len_ids": "025-406-190-240-600", "subject": ["General Agricultural and Biological Sciences", "Statistics and Probability", "Modeling and Simulation", "General Medicine", "Applied Mathematics", "General Immunology and Microbiology", "Modelling and Simulation", "General Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"]}

Research in this field has resulted in many important findings relating to plant and soil sciences. However, there have been scant private and public investments and little commercial success with this technology.

The terminology used in phytotechnologies includes a confusing mish-mash of terms relating to concepts and processes increasing the difficulty of developing a unique commercial image. We argue that the commercial success of phytotechnologies depends on the generation of valuable biomass on contaminated land, rather than a pure remediation technique that may not compare favourably with the costs of inaction or alternative technologies.

In the present study we examined the impact of the CYE on participation in the Junior World Championship in alpine skiing. Based on previous research, we expected to find increasing numbers of participants the older the age-group, and that the CYE would be stronger in the speed events compared to the technical ones. The sample in the present study consisted of 1188 male skiers and 859 female skiers within the age range of 17 to 21 years at the time of competition. The results show that the number of male participants increased with increasing age, which can be described as a CYE. For female skiers, a CYE was found, but it dissipated two years earlier than for male skiers. The CYE varied with event and was more pronounced the higher the speed of the event. The findings thus suggest that a constituent year effect exists among skiers participating in the FIS Junior World Ski Championship in the alpine skiing championships, and that the effect varies with gender and event, rather unrelated to age. Thus, it seems that the effect may not be a relative age effect, but instead a relative development effect.", "DOI": "10.1371/journal.pone.0231384", "len_ids": "005-664-799-949-894", "subject": ["General Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology", "General Medicine", "Multidisciplinary", "General Agricultural and Biological Sciences"]}

{"title": "Dispersibility of carbon nanotubes in organic solvents: do we really have predictive models?", "abstract": "Predicting the physico-chemical properties of carbon nanotubes (CNTs) is highly demanding owing to tedious experimental efforts involved in their determination. Dispersibility of CNTs in organic solvents is one such property; however, studies involving its quantitative prediction are quite scarce and highly questionable, particularly, when the real external predictivity is desired. This work examines the real external predictivity of the existing models as well as those developed in the present work (using quantum-chemical descriptors) for the dispersibility of single-walled CNTs (SWCNTs). The real external predictivity is assessed on the basis of state-of-the-art external validation parameters obtained by employing an external prediction set which is not exposed to the model used for the prediction. Notably, most of the present and existing models pass through the internal validation, but unfortunately, barring some exception of poly-parameter models, most of the models fail when it comes to the external validation. Their failure was attributed to the descriptors employed which are in fact based on the gas-phase single molecular structure of organic solvents as well as based on the implicit solvent methods. A future approach towards the predictive models for the dispersibility of CNTs is suggested based on the explicit solvent methods.", "DOI": "10.1007/s11051-017-3883-x", "len_ids": "078-350-659-453-228", "subject": ["General Chemistry", "Modelling and Simulation", "General Materials Science", "Atomic and Molecular Physics, and Optics", "Bioengineering", "Condensed Matter Physics", "Modeling and Simulation"]}
{"title": "Cellular calcium and redox regulation: the mediator of vertebrate environmental sex determination?", "abstract": "Many reptiles and some fish determine offspring sex by environmental cues such as incubation temperature. The mechanism by which environmental signals are captured and transduced into specific sexual phenotypes has remained unexplained for over 50 years. Indeed, environmental sex determination (ESD) has been viewed as an intractable problem because sex determination is influenced by a myriad of genes that may be subject to environmental influence. Recent demonstrations of ancient, conserved epigenetic processes in the regulatory response to environmental cues suggest that the mechanisms of ESD have a previously unsuspected level of commonality, but the proximal sensor of temperature that ultimately gives rise to one sexual phenotype or the other remains unidentified. Here, we propose that in ESD species, environmental cues are sensed by the cell through highly conserved ancestral elements of calcium and redox (CaRe) status, then transduced to activate ubiquitous signal transduction pathways, or influence epigenetic processes, ultimately to drive the differential expression of sex genes. The early evolutionary origins of CaRe regulation, and its essential role in eukaryotic cell function, gives CaRe a propensity to be independently recruited for diverse roles as a 'cellular sensor' of environmental conditions. Our synthesis provides the first cohesive mechanistic model connecting environmental signals and sex determination pathways in vertebrates, providing direction and a framework for developing targeted experimentation.", "DOI": "10.1111/brv.12582", "len_ids": "006-872-820-500-120", "subject": ["General Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology", "General Agricultural and Biological Sciences"]}

Ultrasound and nuclear magnetic resonance imaging are becoming useful methods for this purpose, but they still lack spatial resolution. In this regard, recent phase contrast x-ray imaging experiments of peripheral nerve allowed the visualization of each nerve fiber surrounded by its myelin sheath as clearly as optical microscopy. In the present study, we attempted to produce high-resolution x-ray phase contrast images of a human sciatic nerve by using synchrotron radiation propagation-based imaging. The images showed high contrast and high spatial resolution, allowing clear identification of each fascicle structure and surrounding connective tissue. The outstanding result is the detection of such structures by phase contrast x-ray tomography of a thick human sciatic nerve section. This may further enable the identification of diverse pathological patterns, such as Wallerian degeneration, hypertrophic neuropathy, inflammatory infiltration, leprosy neuropathy and amyloid deposits.

{"title": "Does an electronic continuum correction improve effective short-range ion-ion interactions in aqueous solution?", "abstract": "Non-polarizable force fields for hydrated ions not always accurately describe short-range ion-ion interactions, frequently leading to artificial ion clustering in bulk aqueous solutions. This can be avoided by adjusting the nonbonded anion-cation or cation-water Lennard-Jones parameters. This approach has been successfully applied to different systems, but the parameterization is demanding owing to the necessity of separate investigations of each ion pair. Alternatively, polarization effects may effectively be accounted for using the electronic continuum correction (ECC) of Leontyev et al. [J. Chem. Phys. 119, 8024 (2003)], which involves scaling the ionic charges with the inverse square-root of the water high-frequency dielectric permittivity. ECC has proven to perform well for monovalent salts as well as for divalent salts in water. Its performance, however, for multivalent salts with higher valency remains unexplored. The present work illustrates the applicability of the ECC model to trivalent K3PO4 and divalent K2HPO4 in water. We demonstrate that the ECC models, without additional tuning of force field parameters, provide an accurate description of water-mediated interactions between salt ions. This results in predictions of the osmotic coefficients of aqueous K3PO4 and K2HPO4 solutions in good agreement with experimental data. Analysis of ion pairing thermodynamics in terms of contact ion pair (CIP), solvent-separated ion pair, and double solvent-separated ion pair contributions shows that potassium-phosphate CIP formation is stronger with trivalent than with divalent phosphate ions.", "DOI": "10.1063/1.5017101", "len_ids": "001-441-560-733-887", "subject": ["General Physics and Astronomy", "Physical and Theoretical Chemistry"]}
{"title": "Viability Assessment in Liver Transplantation-What Is the Impact of Dynamic Organ Preservation?", "abstract": "Based on the continuous increase of donor risk, with a majority of organs classified as marginal, quality assessment and prediction of liver function is of utmost importance. This is also caused by the notoriously lack of effective replacement of a failing liver by a device or intensive care treatment. While various parameters of liver function and injury are well-known from clinical practice, the majority of specific tests require prolonged diagnostic time and are more difficult to assess ex situ. In addition, viability assessment of procured organs needs time, because the development of the full picture of cellular injury and the initiation of repair processes depends on metabolic active tissue and reoxygenation with full blood over several hours or days. Measuring injury during cold storage preservation is therefore unlikely to predict the viability after transplantation. In contrast, dynamic organ preservation strategies offer a great opportunity to assess organs before implantation through analysis of recirculating perfusates, bile and perfused liver tissue. Accordingly, several parameters targeting hepatocyte or cholangiocyte function or metabolism have been recently suggested as potential viability tests before organ transplantation.

{"title": "IDH Mutations in Glioma: Double-Edged Sword in Clinical Applications?", "abstract": "Discovery of point mutations in the genes encoding isocitrate dehydrogenases (IDH) in gliomas about a decade ago has challenged our view of the role of metabolism in tumor progression and provided a new stratification strategy for malignant gliomas. IDH enzymes catalyze the conversion of isocitrate to alpha-ketoglutarate (\u03b1-KG), an intermediate in the citric acid cycle. Specific mutations in the genes encoding IDHs cause neomorphic enzymatic activity that produces D-2-hydroxyglutarate (2-HG) and result in the inhibition of \u03b1-KG-dependent enzymes such as histone and DNA demethylases. Thus, chromatin structure and gene expression profiles in IDH-mutant gliomas appear to be different from those in IDH-wildtype gliomas. IDH mutations are highly common in lower grade gliomas (LGG) and secondary glioblastomas, and they are among the earliest genetic events driving tumorigenesis. Therefore, inhibition of mutant IDH enzymes in LGGs is widely accepted as an attractive therapeutic strategy. On the other hand, the metabolic consequences derived from IDH mutations lead to selective vulnerabilities within tumor cells, making them more sensitive to several therapeutic interventions. Therefore, instead of shutting down mutant IDH enzymes, exploiting the selective vulnerabilities caused by them might be another attractive and promising strategy.

We calculated the diagnostic odds ratio (DOR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) for the first two epidemic weeks and for other epidemic weeks. A total of 4,338 samples were collected in the epidemic weeks, of which 2,446 (56.4%) were positive for influenza. The most predictive case definition for laboratory-confirmed influenza was the WHO case definition for influenza-like illness (ILI) in the first two epidemic weeks (DOR 2.10; 95% CI 1.57-2.81) and in other epidemic weeks (DOR 2.31; 95% CI 1.96-2.72).

Medical inpatients are a very heterogenous group; not all of them need VTE prophylaxis. Current guidelines recommend the use of heparin or related drugs as VTE prophylaxis in medical inpatients at increased risk of thrombosis, and recommends against pharmacologic VTE prophylaxis in patients at low risk. Several risk assessment modules including the Padua Prediction Score, attempt to identify patients at high-risk for thromboembolism. The goal of the study was to evaluate if risk is assessed and defined by clinicians prior to prescribing VTE prophylaxis. Methods A retrospective chart analysis was performed for patients admitted to the medicine service from January 2015 to June 2015. The initial arrival orders as well as the history and physical documented by the admitting physician were reviewed to determine if the risk of VTE was recorded and if VTE prophylaxis was prescribed. Patients were stratified as either admission or observation and the type of anticoagulation was recorded. If the admitting physician did not perform a VTE risk assessment, risk of VTE was calculated using the Padua Prediction Score. Results: Data was collected on a total of 648 patients. 314 (48%) patients met admission criteria and 334 (52%) patients met observation criteria. Chemical VTE prophylaxis was prescribed for 262 of the 314 (83%) admissions and 215 of the 334 (64%) observation patients. Of the 262 admissions that received chemical VTE prophylaxis, 240 (92%) of these patients were considered low-risk based on the Padua Prediction Score (Figure 1). 201 of the 215 (93%) observation patients that received chemical VTE prophylaxis were calculated to be low-risk (Figure 2). Adverse events were found to occur in 7 of the 648 (1.1%) patients that received chemical VTE prophylaxis.

{"title": "Can xenon in water inhibit ice growth? Molecular dynamics of phase transitions in water$-$Xe system", "abstract": "Motivated by recent experiments showing the promise of noble gases as cryoprotectants, we perform molecular dynamics modeling of phase transitions in water with xenon under cooling. We study the structure and dynamics of xenon water solution as a function of temperature. Homogeneous nucleation of clathrate hydrate phase is observed and characterized. As the temperature is further reduced we observe hints of dissociation of clathrate due to stronger hydrophobic hydration, pointing towards a possible instability of clathrate at cryogenic temperatures and conversion to an amorphous phase comprised of \"xenon + hydration shell\" Xe$\\cdot$(H$_{2}$O)$_{21.5}$ clusters. Simulations of ice$-$xenon solution interface in equilibrium and during ice growth reveal the effects of xenon on the ice$-$liquid interface, where adsorbed xenon causes roughening of ice surface but does not preferentially form clathrate. These results provide evidence against the ice-blocker mechanism of xenon cryoprotection.", "DOI": "10.1063/1.4887069", "len_ids": "013-426-919-787-17X", "subject": ["General Physics and Astronomy", "Physical and Theoretical Chemistry"]}

{"title": "High-Elevation Savanna Landscapes in the Cordillera Central, Dominican Republic, Hispaniola: Dambos in the Caribbean?", "abstract": "Headwater unincised savanna (sabana) landscapes in the Cordillera Central, Dominican Republic, have a vegetation cover dominated by the native tussock grass, Danthonia domingensis. Sites occur on gentle-relief upland surfaces approximately between 2000 and 2400 m, mainly in Jose del Carmen Ramirez National Park (JCR) and Juan B. Perez Rancier National Park (JBPR). Surface and subsurface data from 1 site constrain regolith age overlying granitoid saprolite to <12,570 14C years BP.

Dambos elsewhere are widely regarded as reliable indicators of major Quaternary environmental change. Dambos have unique hydrological, ecological, scenic, and utilitarian attributes; their importance will increase with greater tourism, as will the concerns for their sustainable use.

{"title": "Cardiovascular Disease Risk Prediction in Women: Is There a Role for Novel Biomarkers?", "abstract": "Background: Risk prediction is an integral part of the current US guidelines for cardiovascular disease in women. Although current risk prediction algorithms exist to identify women at increased 10-year risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD), clinicians and researchers have been interested in developing novel biomarkers that might improve predictive accuracy further. These biomarkers have led to important insights into the pathophysiology of CVD, but results for their ability to improve prediction or guide preventive therapy have been more mixed. The incidence of CVD is lower in women than men, and the effects of a number of traditional biomarkers on CVD risk differ in women compared to men. Both of these factors influence the ability to accurately predict CVD risk. Content: We review the distinctive aspects of CVD risk prediction in women, discuss the statistical challenges to improved risk prediction, and discuss a number of biomarkers in varying stages of development with a range of performance in prediction. Summary: A variety of biomarkers from different pathophysiologic pathways have been evaluated for improving CVD risk. While many have been incompletely studied or have not been shown to improve risk prediction in women, others, such as high-sensitivity troponin T, have shown promise in improving risk prediction. Increasing inclusion of women in CVD studies will be crucial to providing opportunities to evaluate future biomarkers.", "DOI": "10.1373/clinchem.2013.202796", "len_ids": "049-573-283-811-635", "subject": ["Biochemistry, medical", "Clinical Biochemistry", "Biochemistry (medical)"]}
{"title": "Are there ergodic limits to evolution? Ergodic exploration of genome space and convergence.", "abstract": "We examine the analogy between evolutionary dynamics and statistical mechanics to include the fundamental question of ergodicity\u2014the representative exploration of the space of possible states . Several properties of evolutionary dynamics are identified that allow a generalization of the ergodic dynamics, familiar in dynamical systems theory, to evolution. Two classes of evolved biological structure then arise, differentiated by the qualitative duration of their evolutionary time scales. The first class has an ergodicity time scale  longer than available evolutionary time, and has incompletely explored the genotypic and phenotypic space of its possibilities. This case generates no expectation of convergence to an optimal phenotype or possibility of its prediction. The second, more interesting, class exhibits an evolutionary form of ergodicity\u2014essentially all of the structural space within the constraints of slower evolutionary variables have been sampled; the ergodicity time scale for the system evolution is less than the evolutionary time. In this case, some convergence towards similar optima may be expected for equivalent systems in different species where both possess ergodic evolutionary dynamics. When the fitness maximum is set by physical, rather than co-evolved, constraints, it is additionally possible to make predictions of some properties of the evolved structures and systems. We propose four structures that emerge from evolution within genotypes whose fitness is induced from their phenotypes. Together, these result in an exponential speeding up of evolution, when compared with complete exploration of genomic space. We illustrate a possible case of application and a prediction of convergence together with attaining a physical fitness optimum in the case of invertebrate compound eye resolution.", "DOI": "10.1098/rsfs.2015.0041", "len_ids": "019-189-970-846-480", "subject": ["Biophysics", "Biomedical Engineering", "Biotechnology", "Biomaterials", "Bioengineering", "Biochemistry"]}
{"title": "Is this a man's world? The effect of gender diversity and gender equality on firm innovativeness", "abstract": "Gender diversity is known to have a positive effect on innovation in developed countries. However, it is unclear whether the benefits of gender diversity for innovation also apply to the particular context of developing countries, which is characterized by diverse and lower levels of gender equality. We propose that gender diversity positively impacts innovation in the developing countries participating in our study. In addition, we expect that this effect is moderated by country-specific levels of gender equality. In a cross-country study covering 18,547 firms in 15 developing countries, we find that gender diversity among a firm\u2019s owners and workforce as well as having a female top manager benefit innovation in developing countries. Yet, contradictory to our expectations, gender equality does not significantly moderate this relationship. As such, our results underline the importance of enabling and fostering gender diversity and have critical implications for firms and policy makers alike.", "DOI": "10.1371/journal.pone.0222443", "len_ids": "041-555-416-159-346", "subject": ["General Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology", "General Medicine", "Multidisciplinary", "General Agricultural and Biological Sciences"]}
{"title": "CF3CH3 --> HF + CF2CH2: a non-RRKM reaction?", "abstract": "The experimental shock tube data recently reported by Kiefer et al. [J. Phys. Chem. A 2004, 108, 2443-2450] for the title reaction at temperatures between 1600 and 2400 K have been compared to master equation simulations using three models: (a) standard RRKM theory, (b) RRKM theory modified by local random matrix theory, which introduces dynamical corrections arising from slow intramolecular vibrational energy randomization, and (c) an ad hoc empirical non-RRKM model. Only the third model provides a good fit of the Kiefer et al. unimolecular reaction rate data. In separate simulations, all three models accurately reproduce the experimental 300 K chemical activation data of Marcoux and Setser [J. Phys. Chem. 1978, 82, 97-108] when the energy transfer parameters are freely varied to fit the data. When experimental energy transfer parameters for a geometrical isomer (1,1,2-trifluoroethane) are used, the standard RRKM model fits the chemical activation data better than the other models, but if energy transfer in the 1,1,1-trifluoroethane is significantly reduced in comparison to the 1,1,2 isomer, then the empirical ad hoc non-RRKM model also gives a good fit. While the ad hoc empirical non-RRKM model can be made to fit the data, it is not based on theory, and we argue that it is physically unrealistic. We also show that the master equation simulations can mimic the Kiefer et al. vibrational relaxation data, which was the first shock tube observation of double-exponential relaxation. We conclude that, until more data on the trifluoroethanes become available, the current evidence is insufficient to decide with confidence whether non-RRKM effects are important in this reaction, or whether the Kiefer et al. data can be explained in some other way.", "DOI": "10.1021/jp054510x", "len_ids": "041-757-013-059-557", "subject": ["Physical and Theoretical Chemistry"]}
{"title": "Cadmium Protection Strategies--A Hidden Trade-Off?", "abstract": "Cadmium (Cd) is a non-essential transition metal which is introduced into the biosphere by various anthropogenic activities. Environmental pollution with Cd poses a major health risk and Cd toxicity has been extensively researched over the past decades. This review aims at changing the perspective by discussing protection mechanisms available to counteract a Cd insult. Antioxidants, induction of antioxidant enzymes, and complexation of Cd to glutathione (GSH) and metallothionein (MT) are the most potent protective measures to cope with Cd-induced oxidative stress. Furthermore, protection mechanisms include prevention of endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress, mitophagy and metabolic stress, as well as expression of chaperones. Pre-exposure to Cd itself, or co-exposure to other metals or trace elements can improve viability under Cd exposure and cells have means to reduce Cd uptake and improve Cd removal. Finally, environmental factors have negative or positive effects on Cd toxicity. Most protection mechanisms aim at preventing cellular damage. However, this might not be possible without trade-offs like an increased risk of carcinogenesis.", "DOI": "10.3390/ijms17010139", "len_ids": "153-041-016-826-261", "subject": ["Inorganic Chemistry", "Spectroscopy", "General Medicine", "Physical and Theoretical Chemistry", "Catalysis", "Molecular Biology", "Computer Science Applications", "Organic Chemistry"]}

{"title": "Targeting the gut-skin axis\u2014Probiotics as new tools for skin disorder management?", "abstract": "The existence of a gut-skin axis is supported by increasing evidence, but its translational potential is not widely recognized. Studies linked inflammatory skin diseases to an imbalanced gut microbiome; hence, the modulation of the gut microbiota to improve skin condition seems to be a feasible approach. Today, there is a growing interest in natural products as alternatives to synthetic drugs. In this respect, oral probiotics could be a simple, safe and cheap modality in the therapeutic management of skin inflammation. Unfortunately, very few studies have looked into how probiotic supplementation influences inflammatory skin disorders. The result, though promising, are difficult to implement in clinical practice due to the heterogeneity of the applied supplemental regimen in the different studies. In this Viewpoint, we aim to encourage the conduction of more research in that direction to explore unambiguously the therapeutic potential of oral probiotics in dermatology. We focus on the most common inflammatory skin diseases  with an associated gut dysbiosis, but we also discuss some less common, but very serious skin pathologies  that are possibly linked to a disturbed gut flora composition. We dissect the possible mechanisms along the gut-skin axis and highlight novel points where probiotics could interfere in this communication in the diseased state.", "DOI": "10.1111/exd.14016", "len_ids": "067-294-831-151-49X", "subject": ["Dermatology", "Molecular Biology", "Biochemistry"]}
{"title": "Challenging the golden standard in defining donor-specific antibodies: does the solid phase assay meet the expectations?", "abstract": "The purpose of the study was to compare three different methods defining donor-specific antibodies (DSA): complement-dependent cytotoxicity (CDC), the flow cytometry method (FCM), and a special for that purpose commercially available Luminex-based solid phase assay (SPA). A panel of human monoclonal antibodies (HuMabs) with well-defined human leukocyte antigen (HLA) specificities was used as antibody source and single HLA antigen expressing cell lines (SAL) were used as targets. Two methods yielded identical results (CDC and FCM). However, the SPA, the method by which solubilized HLA molecules from the SAL are captured by microspheres, showed two additional reactions which could not be explained, neither by the epitope recognized by the HuMab nor by the widely accepted sensitivity of the SPA methodology. These unexplained results suggest that by capturing solubilized HLA molecules on microspheres, conformational changes might occur. Positive results obtained by similar Luminex-based microsphere methods should be therefore taken with caution and the \u2018recognized\u2019 HLA antigens should not automatically be considered as unacceptable for transplantation.", "DOI": "10.1111/j.1399-0039.2010.01608.x", "len_ids": "003-310-065-927-919", "subject": ["Immunology and Allergy", "General Medicine", "Genetics", "Immunology", "Biochemistry"]}
{"title": "The Accuracy and Reliability of Traditional Surface Flow Type Mapping: Is it Time for a New Method of Characterizing Physical River Habitat?", "abstract": "Surface flow types (SFT) are advocated as ecologically relevant hydraulic units, often mapped visually from the bankside to characterise rapidly the physical habitat of rivers. SFT mapping is simple, non-invasive and cost-efficient. However, it is also qualitative, subjective and plagued by difficulties in recording accurately the spatial extent of SFT units. Quantitative validation of the underlying physical habitat parameters is often lacking, and does not consistently differentiate between SFTs. Here, we investigate explicitly the accuracy, reliability and statistical separability of traditionally mapped SFTs as indicators of physical habitat, using independent, hydraulic and topographic data collected during three surveys of a c. 50m reach of the River Arrow, Warwickshire, England. We also explore the potential of a novel remote sensing approach, comprising a small unmanned aerial system (sUAS) and Structure-from-Motion photogrammetry (SfM), as an alternative method of physical habitat characterisation. Our key findings indicate that SFT mapping accuracy is highly variable, with overall mapping accuracy not exceeding 74%. Results from analysis of similarity (ANOSIM) tests found that strong differences did not exist between all SFT pairs. This leads us to question the suitability of SFTs for characterising physical habitat for river science and management applications. In contrast, the sUAS-SfM approach provided high resolution, spatially continuous, spatially explicit, quantitative measurements of water depth and point cloud roughness at the microscale (spatial scales \u22641m). Such data are acquired rapidly, inexpensively, and provide new opportunities for examining the heterogeneity of physical habitat over a range of spatial and temporal scales. Whilst continued refinement of the sUAS-SfM approach is required, we propose that this method offers an opportunity to move away from broad, mesoscale classifications of physical habitat (spatial scales 10-100m), and towards continuous, quantitative measurements of the continuum of hydraulic and geomorphic conditions which actually exists at the microscale.", "DOI": "10.1002/rra.3047", "len_ids": "044-582-335-796-303", "subject": ["Environmental Chemistry", "Water Science and Technology", "General Environmental Science"]}
